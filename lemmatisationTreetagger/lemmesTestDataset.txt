always have bit distrust watch British period film usually find insipid and boring screenplay such one example Vanity Fair or other Boleyn Girl but magnificent production design European landscape and thick British accent which make movie suggest artistic value which do not really haveFortunately excellent film Young Victoria do not fall situation and deserve enthusiastic recommendation its fascinating story excellent performance Emily Blunt Paul Bettany and Jim Broadbent and costume and location which unexpectedly make movie pretty rich viewAnd say unexpectedly usually do not pay too much attention detailsVictorian era be my humble opinion one key point contemporary civilization and not only social aspect but also scientific artistic and cultural onesBut honestly do not know origin era very much and maybe because enjoy simplification political and economic event which prepare landing modern era muchI also like way which Queen Victoria be portray which be as young and intelligent monarch whose decision be not always good but be least inspire good intentionsI also find depiction romance Victoria and Prince Albert very interesting be equally interested combination intellect well as emotion evokesThe only fail find movie be screenwriter Julian Fellowes use clichs romantic cinema love story something which feel bit out place his screenplayI like Young Victoria very much and really take very nice surprise itI hope more period film follow example movie costume and landscape should work support interesting story and not replacement

attention SpoilersFirst let say Rob Roy be one good film 90 be be amazing achievement all involve especially acting Liam Neeson Jessica Lange John Hurt Brian Cox and Tim Roth Michael Canton Jones paint wonderful portrait honor and dishonor man can represent but alasit constantly and unfairly get compare Braveheart be two entirely different film probably only similar fact be about Scots historical Scotland yet comparison frequently bother seem be almost assume Braveheart be good film Rob Roy I Braveheart lot but idea compare Rob Roy be little insulting put quite simply love Braveheart but be pale shadow how much love Rob Roy here be my particular reasonsRob Roy be about real peopleLet be face William Wallace Braveheart be not real person be legend martyr large life figurehead depiction be also perfect person never do wrong and basically show his Scot countryman promised land when finally do fail be not his fault Jesus be betray very people trust most even go bad kind torture want freedom muchThe depiction Wallace be very well do and effective but really do nt inspire or intrigue find human ambiguity far more facinating human perfection be why last Temptation Christ be good film King Kings and be also one reason why think Rob Roy be good Braveheart Rob Roy may be heroic and brave but be far perfect make several mistake that affect life many his love one now sure not bear false claim Duke Argyll be act nobility and courage but be also act egoism and self centeredness let not forget kinfolk have claim protect be drive homeless end film act but Rob do good could and be could ask himRob s Wife Mary be also normal ambigious person let start though how look film sure be beautiful but do nt wear makeup and basically allow her natural beauty show Compare two love or one depend your point view William Wallace Braveheart now two lady be hot but hardly indicitive how woman look time especially lay person maybe not fair comparison but just example how Rob Roy s attempt accuracy be far more effectiveThroughout Rob Roy Mary have live her vicious rape dastardly carrion Cunningham she feel compel tell Rob her struggle but do nt know Rob must seek revenge her rape such revenge would surely mean death Rob and Mary be not prepare such sacrificeThe villain Rob Roy be equally as compelling enemy Braveheart be well write be hardly original Robert Bruce man both brave and cowardly be plague moral decision that be all familar fictional realm Should take his claim king Scotland or should betray Wallace order ensure safety his family name Bruce be most ambigious character Braveheart but Brutus Julius Ceasar Fredo Godfather Part II type character be hardly original Longshanks compelling villain his own right be very dimensional be epidemy evil and his tyrant way stand direct contrast Wallace s heroismRob Roy have three villain that be wonderful their chicanery first let s start Marquis Montrose be man who be so obsessed his self image be willing let innocent man suffer see be not mock be his favorite word his factor be man obsess power upset man great noble bearing Duke Argyll can be consider great providency then be shamefully self obsessed and insecure be evil aristocrat but way that make uniqueCunningham and Callarn be conspirator Rob Roy and be also Roy s direct assailant Callarn be so cunning his cowardace be almost comical will do anything maintain good will Marquis which include backstabbing and trickery Cunningham be compelling character that seem have be raise do whatever can obtain status and affection Marquis need father little do know Marquis be his real father therefore when opportunity obtain wealth come Callarn grab even question be very much evil modern man self center and vain care not consequence his action othersMany have criticize Tim Roth s performance film overact Hogwash say be clear Cunningham be not simply evil but also psychopath film world where man and his stepson can go shoot random people amusement be Cunningham too much unbelievable character live society where people seem have decrease value human life Rob Roy simply teach only circumstance decrease value have change be problem human history vanity human heart will not allow capacity compassion Rob Roy and Mary give hope goodness will prevail but snake will always exist our worldAnother character find fascinating be Duke Argyll be true nobleman and his value honesty and courtesy be direct contrast Marquis appreciate bravery Rob Roy and Mary and have direct vexation Marquis and his factor give world hope people power hopefully people Marquis be exception and not rule final duel Rob Roy be more exciting then 10 battle scene BraveheartOne thing get tired be people tell Braveheart be good film battle scene first battle scene be hardly original Spartacus Gladiator Hollywood have have long tradition historical European battle scene Braveheart have good battle scene ever put film but suffer one important problem battle scene have context fight freedomNow do nt get wrong duel be hardly original either fact there be probably 10 time many film duel there be battle scene but context duel Cunningham and Rob Roy be beauty behold be one great scene film history let explain whyFirst all fight style and bearing two character duel describe character perfectly Cunningham be effette and dangerous Rob Roy be strong and courageous Cunningham use fencing sword Rob use broadsword Cunningham fight quick tricky movement Roy s fight style be more obviousThe whole film deliberately slow first half exciting second half be lead up moment be powerful stuff and be clear Rob must exterminate menace evil that have plague his whole world when Rob finally get upper hand literally and figuratively be one great moment film history Rob win have more live and his honor be more powerful 10 Cunningham be use music be absolutely chilling scene good prevail real evil be more powerful see dude get disembowel just so can yell Freedom but hey maybe be just Rob Roy be more realistic BraveheartI do nt know people aristocracy or Scotsman talk people Rob Roy but do feel clearly attempt capture their speech pattern feel many people be bore Rob Roy simply ca nt understand what character be say be case then read Shakesphere or put closecaptioning Rob Roy be actually one great written film 90 be many dialogue film be clever but maybe have watch film couple time understand itBy contrast dialogue Braveheart be hardly very interesting course what do expect when main character be Scotsman play Australian This be legend and there be clearly not attempt capture speech time film take place several century Rob Roy and yet talk people today thus reason many people like good Audiences today have become increasingly lazy and do nt want take time or patience understand thing that be complex therefore as many epic film expect see villians speak recognizable English accent hero speak vernacular not too far away our American language sure be clear Wallace be Scotish but other sound Scotty Star Trek and couple Ayes acknowledgement Scot film fit Hollywood tradition how believe Scot should soundSo do description prove Rob Roy be good film Braveheart hardly but prove one thing show be hardly common knowledge Braveheart be good film Rob Roy put simply Rob Roy be film that have theme that be very apropos today s
