Just Cause showcase Sean Connery Harvard law prof , Kate Capshaw ( do still get work ? ) his wife ( slight age difference ) and Lawrence Fishburne racist southern cop ( ! ) and Ed Harris totally top rendition fundamentalist southern serial killer.Weird casting , but movie play serious mindf** audience . ( do n't read ever intend seriously watch film or ever watch film seriously due spoiler ) first , feel roll my eye repeatedly liberal stereotype : cop be all sadistic and frame black guy evidence . coroner , witness and even lawyer accuse collaborate ( be accuse rape and murder young girl ) be black.Connery be Harvard law prof who give impassioned speech injustice black and barbarous death penalty . be approach convict man 's grandmother defend and re-open trial.Connery be stonewall ( yawn ... ) small town official and good IL ' boy club but find case Blair , alleged killer , now death row , be all fabricate . main evidence be his confession which be beat out him.The beating be administer black cop ( ! ) who even play Russian roulette get confession out .

Connery obviously have make mortgage payment or something .

be great fan Batman comic and become disappoint when could no longer find Batman : animated series TV anymore . be excite learn there be go be new Batman cartoon TV . watch first episode day premier and be very disappointed.First , animation be very poor . look cheap , crappy Japanese anime . then again , just modern-day cartoon be that.The character design be even bad . Batman look more Birdman , Catwoman look more Chihuahuawoman , Bane look more red version Hulk , Penguin be Kung-Fu master , Mr. Freeze be undead thing iceberg his head , and Riddler be Gothic Marilyn Manson look-alike ( which be funny do n't expect people who be obsess riddle and puzzle be Gothic).The bad character design be Joker . turn monkey/demented Bob Marley/Kung-Fu fighter ! Joker be suppose be Batman 's deadly enemy , but show hardly pose threat his crime be so stupid and pointless . one episode his plan be put his Joker venom dog food ! oh , how evil ! Batman be fascinating and complex character be haunt death his parent , which be why fight crime . version Batman do n't seem haunt his parent ' death and be notinteresting . be also notdetective , just fighter . there be enemy ca n't defeat , wo n't study enemy find out their weak point detective would , will just build giant fight robot defeat . lot time show do n't even feel Batman show , just brainless anime that be nothing but pointless fighting.What hate most show be what do villain . have take away everything that make likable and relatable and turn stereotypical evil bad guy . Man-Bat be big example . comic , be tragic scientist who study bat find cure his deafness . when experiment , accidentally transform giant bat creature . show , be mad scientist who want purposely transform giant bat creature apparent reason . just all villain be ; none , exception about one or two , have actual motive their crimes.The bad characterization be Mr. Freeze . comic , freeze be just mad scientist genius writer Paul Dini write BTAS episode " Heart Ice " , which give freeze new origin that make more tragic , three-dimensional , and likable villain . episode be so popular fan accept his actual origin and be even use comic his origin . even crappy movie Batman & Robin use his origin . show , be petty jewel thief become Mr. Freeze . become Mr. Freeze , guess what ? be Still petty jewel thief ! great origin . wonder use one Dini created.As Batman fan , do n't dislike show just be n't comic also like BTAS , Batman cartoon that come , Tim Burton 's Batman film , and obviously , superb Christopher Nolan Batman film . none be 100 % loyal comic , but be still very good . problem show be notbe notexactly comic or BTAS , be lack sort depth that make other Batman medium popular.I have give show many chance , but more watch , more find that disappoint . miss good old day back when Batman cartoon be something everyone could enjoy .
see chance show cable on want like think Sandra be quite funny what remember . only facial movement have movie be jaw drop stunned how awful movie just suffer through.The person who say be one funny movie time please point one line , just one scene , that be even worth chuckle.She be much good singer remember be , but do n't want watch lounge act.I think be movie try hard like think should and do n't view objectively .
probably give more credit deserve 's Halloween , be just " Knott 's Scary Farm " and be mood watch really cheesy Halloween movie.Oh , and only cost one dollar.Usually will ffwd movie get " good stuff , " but resist urge here and be still notsure why . be obvious opening shot this be n't " real " movie , noteven B-movie . be more category Decoteau " horror " movie " Brotherhood " that be shoot film-look video about 50 cent ( fact , be half afraid minute one his beefy college boy would stagger out rub his underpants or something ) . there be cutaway shot ( too expensive do multiple camera setup ) and flat lighting but ... be hard pinpoint . there be something refresh watch director money pull off half-decent movie . fact be do even half-decent job be commendable , and movie have be share merits--the acting be n't bad , photography be pretty good ( too bright be scary ) , there be surprise , and whole thing be sort ... different somehow.A bunch college kid be ( unknown reason ) stick warehouse where be decorate annual haunted house . creepy old man give satanic book and accidentally summon up power hell . result costume people haunted house become who be make up be , and cause lot mayhem and human suffering . way be treat oddly complex and thoughtful lesbian relationship subplot--it be interesting couple seem be most well-rounded movie . yes , there be sex scene but be n't salacious--or least more so will find legit movie lesbian that show have sex . be rather unusual horror film take time and effort do resort cheap exploitation.The other thing that hold my interest be how be clearly try emulate " stupid kid have sex and get kill " vibe 80 's slasher . be hard take there be so many film that already exist , genre have be do death . be notsure be good or bad filmmaker simply try make entry genre , irony , as be still LIVING genre , but appreciate attempt.Which be why sit ; sometimes just want watch mindless , no-budget , " A-for-effort " horror film . there really be too much set up , notenough gore , endless plot-holes , dead-ends and clichs and unfortunate overall feel movie that simply do nothave enough money be film producer envision ... but very least haunted house scene be pretty cool . will pay go haunted house exist , and do n't mind pay dollar see DVD even will never watch again.Oh , and **possible spoiler** , but there be great , brief business vampire girl coffin : " use be claustrophobic . but have change . " Ha ha , good one .
film be pure pain . sit theater x-amount minute , be wonder when film be go start . all setup be place ; typical love story , character have overcome their short-givings , villain have emerge , but none ever initiate . time thing happen , be already bore stiff and device be completely ineffective . scene that require immense tension and buildup , feel necessary frame be cut . Kid 's stuff do nothave be way . child 's film can be as riveting and engaging adult one . excuse , " hey , its kid , " be bull . will take " Sword Stone " day . be terrible . be get feeling Disney will put out anything day . and kid , 10-year see this will agree ... pure trash .
what dreadful movie ! reason , scientific laboratory and outpost always have staff grubby , dirty , mean-spirited , misanthrope live inside . folk who presumably work together complicated scientific project can seem agree how survive death hand CGI Dragon . spoiler : extra-nasty scientist whose main act skill be " leer " and " sinister stare " have clon Dragon . lab be suppose work kind thing , other scientist be shock , apparently be way their experiment and get catch their pant down . rest story be thing , or Ten Little Indians , where staff be hunt and kill off try formulate way escape and/or defeat " Dragon . " CGI Dragon creature be dark gray , which seem be popular color most cheap CGI special effect . hardly look good cartoon , and dark gray tone make difficult see interesting detail body Dragon . all look be gray blob . acting be less horrible . scientist act bunch child who can agree anything , and make easy Dragon kill off various attempt escape , hide , etc. Dean Cain be hardly good cast unknown actor movie . seem sink level his supporting cast . movie be really , really atrocious . acting be bad . story be dumb . CGI be very very cheap and amateurish . there be nothing commendable movie , be noteven good time-killer glance do chore or other work .

do n't understand people . why be movie be get 8.3 ! ! ! ! ! ! ? ? ? ? have high hope movie , but once i be about half hour just want leave theater . vast majority review site people be say be one good action movie have see ( or summer , year , etc. ) say be excellent conclusion . WTF ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ? ? ? ? ? ? what have be conclude ( fact Bourne can ride motorcycle , shoot , and fight good anyone else come ) ? what do learn Bourne 's character movie ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? absolutely f****** nothing ! ! ! ! ! ! ! okay , there be lot action , but what be so great action movie ? ? do n't like cinematography and film edit . shaky camera effect and fast change shot be use Too much and get old fast ( do n't mind supremacy be still easy follow and be notuse excess ) and make quite dizzy . be quickly wish have save my $$$ something else.This movie have plot . all movie be be 115 minute chase see . Bourne , who learn absolutely nothing about entire 115 minute movie , be perfectionist everything attempt . there be absolutely character development movie , know nothing anyone , and there be wide array new character that be introduce installment . people say movie have incredible writing and suspense . ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! what writing ? ? ? ? what suspense ? ? ? there be suspense . Bourne be so perfect do everything do , do n't think have anything worry about . be good movie year 2007 may just quit watch movie entirely ! ! ! !Many people have also say Matt Damon 's performance movie be one good ( notgood ) his career . what performance ? ? how many line do have movie ? ? ? have respect Damon have be movie like and have play different kind character , but good actor be someone can barely recognize one movie next , someone who choose different type role . notsomeone who play same role and again ( which Damon do n't do , but example someone who do be Vin Diesel).Anyways , movie be Big disappointment . do notrecommend movie but do recommend first two ( Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy ) and most definitely recommend read three book ( which be much different then movie ) .
This be arguably bad film have ever see , and have quite appetite awful ( and good ) movie . could ( just ) have manage kind adolescent humour have be consistently tongue-in-cheek -- la Rocky HORROR Picture Show , which be really very funny . other movie , Plan Nine From Outer Space , manage be funny ( apparently ) try be serious . acting , look round up brain-dead teenager and ask ad-lib whole production . compare , Tom Cruise look Alec Guinness . there be one decent interpretation -- that old ghoul-busting broad motorcycle .
 Capt. Gallagher ( Lemmon ) and flight attendant Eve Clayton ( Vaccaro ) be supposedly hot item death trip ; luxury 747 airliner deck out look nightclub-slash-hotel there be even blind piano player who fall love . Karen Wallace ( Grant ) be hysterical b ! $3& who will do anything get attention henpecked husband Martin ( Christopher Lee ) and , later , rest people board.Memorable moment : Boeing 747 do belly flop Atlantic Ocean , Karen get her chop bust when go too far , and furniture ( and scream people ) who become ' ball bearing ' sinking ' pinball machine.'The action and rescue sequence here be relatively phenomenal , but notmuch go on . Hitchcock be suppose have direct sequel , but forget reason why notwould have do wonder 1970 original , which sequel be partly inspired ( ' 77 also get inspiration ` flight Phoenix').Actors Cotten and de Havilland reunite their day ` Hush , Hush , Sweet Charlotte ' ( apparently here be notplay heavy , just reunite Autumn Years ' lover ) . and be n't actress play Emily 's companion same one who play hammered-to-death maid ` whatever happen Baby Jane ? ' TV actor include girlfriend ` Mayberry RFD ' ( her character 's daughter win drawing contest , or something lame ) , ` Buck Rogers ' Gil Gerard and ` Dynasty 's ' Pamela Bellwood .
be n't anyone else tire old clich ' where nearly dead person show up horror film , give information , and then blast his head off apparent reason ? know am.The sad thing be be use film be worthless . have see first film ( first remake should say ) then information give be completely worthless , would have already know . guess , can that be n't worthless main characters..but then why do idiot shoot head ? would n't want live ? sure , would have die anyway..This be second film be title " Hills Have eye II . " first be sequel original 70 's film . be where get little complicate someone . see , be probably part minority people my age that even know there be HHE2 begin , much less original HHE1 . and now have sequel remake and fact sequel be name exactly sequel original HHE1 ... just make bad ! but anyways..Wes Craven 's original Hills Have eye be decent . end , though , idea be good presentation , but most likely have low budget . be quite honest , Wes Craven be n't good horror director . be only make few good horror movie ( Nightmare Elm St. , New Nightmare ) , few alright one ( Scream ) and bunch horrible one ( Cursed , Shocker , Vampire Brooklyn ) . oh yeah , and make Swamp Thing , as well ... but original HHE2 fall latter category . have only see few minute , but be terrible.Now have co-write new HHE2..and be such disappointment ! last year 's HHE remake be even good original film . be tense . guess have do fact main character be family , and notbunch beer and pot and sex crazy teenager . make feel dirty . first hour , be hell , and finally last few moment , good guy get revenge bad guy and feel good..This new film have tension . suspense whatsoever . just violent thing happen mostly stupid people . there be hardly menace presence here . just ugly hobo hide rocks.I be get tired horror movie where people die stupid mistake keep make . be just other day watch " Deep Blue Sea " where Samuel L. Jackson keep walk around water , give speech , and then get eat shark , only idiot stay close water..something nobody would do give situation ! here be exact same thing . people go off take leak even know people be dying..seriously , could n't potty break wait ? and then when think people would have learn , someone else go ! seriously , be n't more scary when character be bring their A-game and still lose ? would think so ... even deliver . should have make first remake look " Fog " remake ( which be less menace episode " Becker " ) . more bad guy . more time cave . more tension . more everything.But actually downgrade . less bad guy . tension . sure have more time cave , but notwhole lot happen there . end , only seem there be two or three bad guy . last film make seem whole tribe people . where be tribe ? who keep watch binoculars ? seriously , be thing film should have bring , but end exact same promise last film give , exact same " be watch " scene . come ! will give devil be due . look film be good..but thats it.I do n't even think fan gore will like this..though be probably wrong ! there be gore ( most be sped-up dark ) , but tension , and character even care about..the gore do nothing my book ! end , be notfrighten . ; notshocked ( be 8 year old girl ) . do n't even feel have see anything new .
 Yes , know be one few people long trample movie dust oblivion.So let tell why feel way . truth,had be advertise Zombie film or like,I might have enjoy it.But right now,I be totally speechless.*SPOILER ... Though I be notsure what be spoil* Let 's start first Huge flaw . do notknow movie be call " darkness - VAMPIRE Version " and have notsee sequence where individual seem be suck blood , would nothave see connection Vampires . mean , FANGLESS ? ? ? ? give break ! ! ! second bad point : what be metal ? appear young people , but mainly so-called " vampire " , be various kind Metal,judging mainly their shirt ! do n't get wrong , have be more extreme form music almost 15 year , but nobody ' s go scare show ridiculous teenager Iron Maiden ( band ! ! ! ) T-shirt run around,pretending be Vampires ! " pathetic " be only only word could use here.Third weakness : actor . wait minute . what actor ? ! mean director 's wooden friend ! word would be waste here.Yes , alright , movie be very gory , but what difference do that make ? WOULD have be strong point and something enjoy " briliant " director have notchoose create artificial vampire topic movie . want see Vampires,but be treat stupid look kid would have love use my baseball bat . Film-makers should simply have advertise movie say " cheap B-grade horror plot but lot gore " ! ! ! movie be blasphemy whole concept Vampirism . and make sick .
 Justifications what happen his movie term distributor and secondary director , drunk and receptionist do script rewrite aside , let be just take movie be offer , extraneous explanations.This movie be God awful . straight up craptastic . rather rehash what may serve plot , will run highlight reel curious point that make scratch my head.A class ( 5 ) take field trip history class middle friggin ' nowhere Ireland . student may be Canadian or American , be difficult tell . be film Canadian forest rather Ireland be rather obvious well . One student seem know nothing history and be basically " dumb jock " character number kick ass @card@ 's movie , when channel Randy Scream . One character may be Chris Klein 's stunt double . have girlfriend who probably get kill , but be never really establish be true . One character be sullen and remove her peer ... just ... cuz ... and then there be blonde girl . Yay blonde girl.Ireland have population 2 . be cousin . Gary , who be clearly same age or young rest cast , be call " sir " more once . be very ominous and wear knit cap. his cousin be rough up porn star bad Irish accent befoul film my lifetime and most likely beyond.Picturesque Ireland feature many Canadian forest and swampy area and 2 duck which appear more once cut scenes.The producer get discount volume fake entrails . good them.Unbeknownst , horribly inbreed freak have access brand spanking new hunting knife . perhaps there be kind outdoorsman outlet nearby blind and deaf clerk work register.Also unbeknownst , inbreed roughly 600 year , story lead believe happen , end up be somewhat lumpy , yet amazingly spry and fairly strong . Genetics be wonderful game craps.There may or may notbe more one freak film . reference be make " " and see shadow , yet only one odd look dude be see ever . and when one odd look dude be finally kill , apparently danger be pass . be run my initial assumption one thought outfit second man full make up , thus just use one . be what look screen , anyway.Richard Grieco should be ashamed.Also note , aside shiny new knife , inbred freak have access posh leather gear , as Richard Grieco cut his bond , there be fresh one ready next sucker who get tie up ... who also then escape , chain give enough slack just undo , make one wonder why even bother tie anyone up.A dead body shack will be maggot-ridden what would guess be about 2 hour have pass . say dead body will also have glass , when character wear . Curious.Jenna Jameson appear reason stage left , chat 2 minute , vanish stage leave . middle giant forest . be notunusual , Gary can also pop out nowhere , which be also know whatever exist TV land screen.Ms . Jameson die sadly and somehow her clothes vanish my hope movie would n't suck wind.I offer special nod " Breeder " character , poor girl who have be use freak month ( or maybe year ) breed purpose . poor girl who still have eye shadow and emote camera all passion and conviction stuffed chihuahua.The end movie be clearly tack drunk or someone fierce mental disability that have be cultivate and encourage excessive gasoline drinking years.Apparently be n't just random crap find movie network late night , apparently people have hear and even follow movie 's production . how sad all . have nothing more say . May God have mercy all .
i go hope would be " thought provoke " little gem people have review as . i love indy film and expect dig too . know what hot button topic be i expect be really entertain , maybe even see outsider perspective.all i can say be wow ... .if your self torture , or mutilation then maybe will like . personally i do n't like idea be pee will on or cut i think be garbage . bad script , bad acting , bad story , bad directing , bad edit ... .i could go on . i have clue why reviewer claim or be make political point give movie 10 . be mislead and ignorant . vote movie IMDb be n't set precedent ! just let other people think garbage bomb be OK watch as long be controversial ( film be not, try VERY Hard be but fails).you know movie be bad when 15 minute your pray main character die horrifically . unfortunately do die , but notpainful manner that would have give viewer justice or vindication have watch 2 hour crap just endured.do favor , just do n't even bother . i get movie bargain bin my local video store .50 and feel rip off !
One bad movie have ever see . act be terrible , both kid and adult . most character show no , little or notenough emotion . lighting be terrible , and there be too many mess up time day film be shoot ( river scene where just get their boat destroy , there be 4 shot ; sheriff and Dad evening their boat , Jillian and Molly evening swimming , rest kid daytime *when be suppose evening* river bank , and doctor , Beatrice , and Simonton night but notevening get off their boat . ) good act movie be probably sheriff , Cappy ( , there be slip character when pulse detector *Whatever thing be when people die , beeps* show Cappy have die , still move can still be hear beeping , and nurse extra check his pulse manually , then show pulse again , and THEN finally die . ) guess be notgo be perfect , be independent movie , but still could be good . notworth watching , honestly , even kid . might as well watch something good , Lion King or Toy Story be go see anything will remember .
just see movie TV and have admit , be bit surprise be even on . there be so many goof , mess-up , and bad edit old episode Sesame Street would have be good watch . act be OK , but please , can really feel " Straight Video " feeling . cast/crew make movie bad melodrama . yes , there be message movie , but just wait ten minute ending hear . trust , would n't even tell difference .
This be bad movie . notone funny bad one either . be lousy bad one . be actually painful watch . direction be awful,with lot jump around and green and yellow hue use movie make character look sickly . Keira Knightly be notconvincing tough chick all,and can believe Lucy Liu and Mickey Rourke sign criminal waste celluloid . script be terrible and act be fingernail chalkboard . have n't see it,do n't . be notmiss anything and will only waste two hour your life watch drivel .I have see bad movie before and even enjoy due their fault . one be just waste time .
will dispense usual comparison certain legendary filmmaker know his neurotic New Yorker persona , quite frankly , draw comparison bumble loser Josh Kornbluth , be just insult such director . will also avoid mention spot-on satire ` Office Space ' same breath celluloid catastrophe . can , however , compare wake up your own surgery be painful watch and wonder surgeon really know what be do . haiku Tunnel be kind film wish have pull plug its early stage production . be cruel let live and result , audience world be be make suffer.The film 's premise indeed have one be noteven worth discuss , but sake caution will . Josh Kornbluth , temp worker severe commitment-phobia , be offer permanent job . his main duty be mail out 17 high priority letter his boss . but ludicrously , be unable perform simple task . my reaction ? big deal ! be notstory be pass thought good - one that should have pass self-respecting filmmaker by.The lead actor can call that be clumsy buffoon man , chubby feature , recede , untamed hairline , and series facial expression that range cringe-making plain disturbing . where o where do director find schmuck ? what be say be director ? oh , my mistake . play your own embarrassment screenplay be one thing , but suspect Mr Kornbluth be n't convincing human be , let alone actor . rest assure , be mean aimless character assassination , but never before have be so rile up actor 's on-screen presence ! my frustration be further confound his incessant to-camera monologue scene . mean , as viewer need ounce intelligence comprehend drivel , Kornbluth insult further ` explain ' action ( first rule filmmak : ` dramatize exposition ' show , do n't tell ) . who do guy think be ? have charisma , charm , and judge his Hawaiian shirt , sense style . his casting agent should be shoot point blank ! supporting actor do nothing relieve intense boredom feel , but one exception . Patricia Scanlon put very funny appearance Helen ex-secretary , who have be drive insane her old boss , and make harass phone call her basement , hold flashlight her face . do make chuckle , but moment soon pass and be back check my watch remainder film.The film 's title be also misnomer . haiku Tunnel have nothing do ancient form Japanese poetry . do n't be fool think be art house film its pretentious-sounding title or fact only play handful cinema and make money box office there be very good reason !
no wonder movie never see light day . timing be release be awful . Gong Show have already " jump shark " time movie come out , so who would pay money just see few censor clip original run show ? and show clip be just tiny bit pathetic , 90-minute whine Chuck Barris how hard his life be host show . do really expect would feel sorry and his messed-up millionaire life ? do really think even want Know his life ? ( obviously so , later write his weird autobiography his career CIA operative . ) do think gag have everyone , everywhere audition would stay fresh 90 minute ? or network executive hound turn ? might have work plot 30-minute sitcom episode , but notfull-length movie . however , be nice see Rip Taylor , Gene Gene , and unknown comic again ( , make movie " spicy , " include only his most vulgar routine ) . and someone else have point out , be Phil Hartman 's first significant movie part ( even last only minute ) . note his name be spell Hartmann credit , which be name be bear . ca n't miss his voice and facial expression , even be much thin and young SNL day . Ed Molinaro ( Hill Street Blues ) also have tiny part ; one his first leave soap world .
This be only movie my wife and have ever walk out . totally suck . see Omaha even . notfunny , look 14 year old kid write humor . ca n't believe real politician be actually movie . awful .
 Awful . thriller should have bury . what piece crap . terrible writing , character be less believable . horrible Schlock ! ! stick B- star terribly write POS try and give little credit , but fail miserably . do n't have write ten line movie would have give word word review , start ' sh ' and end ' it'.Horrible ending , retarded . who write crap . ending film be so contrived , weak be as have idea what do story line , or just run out money . most likely due number cameo movie . be good thing actor be way out , would be career killer . good thing hardly anyone will see . least one important , future investor . could have end thousand different way , but as be , feel cheat out my precious time.Do n't bother one , will feel waste time can never get back .
just dumb old movie . First Stanwyck 's son get his foot trap really dumb way , and then her husband get his foot trap really dumb way . effort save , Stanwyck get unlucky , yet again , and come escape convict . have chance kill but fail very dumb way . end her husband be save , and Stanwyck tell narration what dumb message movie be . be well end dumb.I could never figure out how unattractive woman Stanwyck ever make lead lady Hollywood 's glamour-oriented Golden Era ; nose be so beautiful so photogenic film be mercifully short , run little hour . be as director sense be make crap , so think well keep crap short .
as far can tell , spite early comment post other commentors , film be currently available DVD . find only few week ago.It be Value DVD label and pay grand total 98 cent plus tax . find 98 cent store rack plastic bowl and disposable chopstick . now do n't people who shell out beau coup buck super-duper Swedish import limited edition version feel be have ? ? ? think so.This film be indeed well worth 98 cent . 99 cent , might start argue . but clearly worth 98 cent . and remember say get what pay . slasher film maven only .
be disgusting and painful . what waste cast ! swear , audience ( 1/2 full ) laugh TWICE 90 minute . be notlie . do noteven rent it.Zeta Jones be just too mean be believable.Cusack be OK . just OK . feel sorry ( actor ) case people remember mess.Roberts be same always be . charming and sweet , but purpose . " romance " John be completely unbelievable .
Man , movie suck big time ! do n't even manage see hole thing ( my girlfriend do though ) . really bad acting , computer animation so bad just laugh ( woman werewolf ) , strange clip , list go and . do n't know its just or do movie remind porn movie ? and do n't mean all naked ladys ... 's something light or something ... could maybee become classic just bad acting and all naked woman , but notbe original movie white nice plot twist . my final word be : do n't see ! be notworth time . wanna see nakedness there be lot good one see !
film be exactly what get when really over stretch your ability , be someone who have just pass there drive test and then pit formula 1 Grand Prix ( notmight add , US Grand Prix everyone might pull out due dodgy tyre and might just win ) , that be how far short film fall . now do n't take wrong way , love B-Movies , half my collection be make B-Movies but do n't think there be enough letter alphabet describe how bad film is.First story ( B-Movie ) be n't bad , have potential there make B-Movie brand , be nottalk Friday 13th potential , but potential none less . but what really let film down be act , notone second do believe anything , be watch QVC presenter QVC tend have heavy tan.In summary will like say have see bad film , but ca n't .
even there be repertoire over 180 film choose , this ' Succubus ' be often name good Jess Franco film . heck , even legendary filmmaker Fritz Lang count ' succubus ' his personal favorite . so , maybe be but think be dreadfully boring and overly confusing movie . opening be great , though , and show Janine Reynaud perform Sm act stage . be all downhill here , unfortunately . Reynaud 's character be maneater who eventually kill her lover sort trance . Franco have decent budget work and spend well nice location , beautiful photography and mesmerize musical score .

way , Corridors Time be success story movie reach its goal : be see thousand . but fail make laugh ... Les Visiteurs have have its success , subject be original way consider time travel : forget Zemeckis 's back future , here come old France , middle-age knight and its nearly barbaric way life . full pride , funny thanks ancient word use , Montmirail can sometimes be disgusting but keep his honor . then come sequel.Nobody have foresee tremendous success Les Visiteurs , first . and be use be movie expert realize Corridors Time have be make money.The general story begin end Les Visiteurs , and immediately try justify sequel time paradox that would have need second tought . explanation : be use try get back jewelry Jacquouille have steal ; do n't remember nice red shiny and expensive car buy end 1st episode ? where do think find money ? sell jewelry ... and be only one many hole Poir try avoid ... and fails.Let have have look character : Montmirail do n't change , be just little more boring . regard Frenegonde ... that be story : Valrie Lemercier decide notcompromise sequel avoid get stuck bourgeoise role . and Muriel Robin try imitate way find so pitiful nearly feel pain . and Poir do n't realize cast humorist be n't enough make good comedy.Forget time travel , digital effect , concentrate story and will see there be enough room mail stamp write 10 times.The main interest film be landscape . movie youngster , let be say up 13 year old .

This be short terrible disappointment . far bad adaptation one my favourite novel . dialogue be horribly clumsy ; could sense feeling word express character . line be deliver too hastily and feel rather out place . could just as well have be cite statue . chemistry George C. Scott and Susannah York be non-existent and watch American Rochester feel strange . could have least try do British accent . like George C. Scott actor , but simply do notwork . feel be watch highlight Jane Eyre , where main piece story have be randomly put together regard flow story . scenery and music be very nice , but could feel none passion and love that be suppose be Jane and Rochester and movie leave totally unmoved.If want see good version Jane Eyre suggest watch 1983 BBC version Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke or 1997 version Ciarn Hinds and Samantha Morton . now two be brilliant adaptation .
want see movie ever be first advertise TV . go Tinsel Town see last Night 7:40 . regret day that waste my ticket trash when could saw something well . beginning be all bunch sex trash and clich . exaggerate way love work reality . girl be stereo type . boyfriend be too stupid his own age . pass gas pregnant girl keep have barely get laugh . bank robbery be completely boring gag that have be use other movie . their getaway car be old beat Chevy van claim have break . hey why do n't get nice girlish vehicle robbery instead ? might have boost audience opinion movie . movie be very low low low low low budget nothing there be damage or destroy . movie have lot stuff that would drive Christian people nut . hey even expect car chase scene bank rob movie have car chase but but there be never any . so rate movie b which stand low budget and 1 out ten star .
perhaps bad thing Carlos Mencia 's comedy be joke need be follow insult people crowd that be n't laugh . there be anybody who be insecure , be comedian who wo n't shut up his audience.Then again , perhaps bad thing Carlos Mencia 's comedy be do n't get off his free speech high horse . want be funny , just make joke , do n't explain all reason why be save American way your failed attempt generate laughter.Hmm ... actually ... bad thing Carlos Mencia 's comedy be substitues meanspirited jab ethnicities legitimate humor . avoid plague .
 Maaan , where do i start god awful movie . bad bad bad story tell . do notknow what director be think when make movie . Namaste London be quite enjoyable movie be honest..even soundtrack be good . but one..oh my good..for movie which be suppose be musical one..the song be soooo bad . Ar Rahman should have be music director.Given two great actor much good job should have be do director . even first half suck , last 30 min movie be OK . performance Salman and Ajay save movie be total disaster.Watch have nothing well do . last good movie Bollywood i watch ( and i do watch load ) be Dev D and Wake Sid .
there be way avoid comparison Cat Hat and Grinch who Stole Christmas , so let be get part out way . first , let start say think Grinch be underrate and unappreciated film . Cat be ... well , just awful.Jim Carey be cast be brilliant physical comedian , and fearlessly commit top , outrageous character . Mike Myers fall back his old bag tricks.Why , why , why Mike Myers ? ? kid could care less , and Austin Powers demographic be n't go spy film . so , what be studio thinking ? Cat be also apparently relate Linda Richmond . can talk ? why New York Accent ? notentirely consistent anything Dr. Seuss have ever write . Myers be even allow sneak his Scottish shtick . wonder how many different voice director and studio try edit out just give and say " as long do n't say fahklempt ' , can keep accent . " Meyers never seem find sort comfort , either costume , make-up , or dialogue.The joke , what few there be , be crude and age inappropriate . when Myers pick up garden hoe and deliver camera : " dirty ho " , everything but rim shot be miss , and even that would n't have helped.The same folk who create ' Whoville ' , clearly have hand creation town and house ' Cat ' . set and prop be very appealing , give viewer much needed distraction bad writing , direction , and Myers.There be fun be have Alec Baldwin and Kelly Preston . Dakota Fanning be only actor who seem be aware be movie base Dr. Seuss classic , and stay true genre.Call SPCA . Cat should be neuter and never be allow reproduce again . please , please , sequel .
poor excuse amateur hour showcase be herald Sundance be great example what be wrong most indie filmmaker days.First , there be such thing art cinematography . just pick up 16mm camera and point whomever have line do notmake real movie.I guess have consider lucky director do n't pick up someone 's camcorder ... Second , indie film be suppose be about real people . there be nothing real film . none character come as be even remotely human.What come as be be figment imagination writer try impress his buddy show how " cool and edgy " is.Sorry , but be notgood writing , or good directing.What be leave be husk bad movie that somehow make its way Sundance . hard believe be one good film submit ... case , make loose what be leave my respect Sundance brand .
have great name , but thats and wont get more your money , fact first 30-40mins movie might find kind funny but story go one side particular reason and just cant understand whats happen action its gone.And yet producer ( Roberto Angel Salcedo ) call actor , but i do n't think way do could be call nothing but overact ! ! ... .period . little kid who play his son have totally sense act and i believe be just favor do or something have clue what be doing.For reason do casting think cast comedian could make , but do n't ! ! and sometimes tasteless cheap humor its so bad , i do n't buy it.But hopefully be as bad get . make people accept DVD 's good taste public will have offer food , that might work out.Maka
Dane try hard and be extreme his yell and go crazy , spill water and roll floor . much . calm down , get together and make laugh . do n't quite understand his comparison comic and rock star . just there both up stage or something ? say comedian want be rock star . be sure Rodney Dangerfield be really when be alive . have few good joke Burger King joke where people yell drive thru . also like Reese 's Pieces joke . Dane just do n't act so mental might be funny and might have give high rating , as high maybe eight .
Jane Eyre_ be one great novel English language and screenwriter should read . hate when writer use Spark note what novel be all about . movie be unbearable watch have read book.The whole ' red room ' be so down play wonder why even bother put in . book the ' red room ' be foreshadow WHOLE story and rest Jane 's life . Helen Burns be treat so badly movie be sure be happy die and leave early . book be one most compelling character and be notred head . whole Christian theme be miss her life and rest movie.Do favor and miss movie and read story Charlotte Bronte masterfully tell .
group human look alien go Earth eat crash land planet prehistoric beast instead where all eat physcedelic mushroom and act retarded . pad footage " planet Dinosuars " and horrible joke be definitely one miss . acting be atrocious well , and be n't as bad " Chickboxer " ( what movie can be ? ) be still pretty awful repugnant stuff . be 90 minute run time feel eternity and will likely be curse life so do huge favor and just move , skip crappy film , there be nothing see here.The film-makers try resell turd MST3K style make fun movie make decade before , and work extent be still nothing watchable , Ariauna Albright be hot , but Lilith Stabs have pretty unattractive speaking voice.My Grade : D-DVD Extras : joke commentary , 17 scene featurette ; 7 minute black featurette ; Jessica Mills reporting ; Stills gallery ; and original trailer
movie be total dog . find strain find anything laugh just so would n't feel have totally waste my money--and my time . writing film be absolutely terrible . be shame be notup standard other Hale Storm movies.They should have save money get D-list actor Fred Willard and Gary Coleman and spend money work script be right . even Gary Coleman be n't properly utilize his role.This movie leave wonder what point most plot was--including subplot . view movie , be leave impression producer be hope capture kind Napolean Dynamite-like humor , where be notmuch line character and delivery . unfortunately , movie fail deliver line , character , delivery or humor . should have go dentist instead !
This be almost certainly bad Western have ever see . story follow formula that be especially common Western and martial art film -- hero learn family/friends have be murder , so hero set out exact revenge , foil ineffective lawman , rescue kidnap loving damsel , and murder expert arch-nemesis brutal duel . formula have often be successful -- otherwise would n't be formula -- but Gunfighter be most sophomoric execution will ever see . script be atrociously simple-minded and insulting ; sound high schooler write dialogue lack depth , maturity , and realism . sound be bad ; sometimes look dub . cinematography be lame , and set be sometimes just facade . acting be pitiful ; sure , performer could blame script , but other can use excuse . hope never see Chris Lybbert speak role ever again ; time say line that should be angry or mean , do nothing more lower timbre his voice and just sound kid try act macho . and speak Chris Lybbert , who play Hopalong , check out his dud ( dare watch film ) : wear brand new clothes that make look more Roy Rogers hard-working , down-and-dirty cowboy . enjoy inane cinematic fare that serve merely worship imagine grandeur Hopalong Cassidy , then get , but have more two neuron , watch something else .
go movie Sneak Preview Austria . so do n't have idea what be go see . story be very normal . movie be very long , believe could have cut 1/2 cause problem story . its type movie can see boring night which want get bored more !

Mr. Mikels and his silly little handlebar mustache actually have people who Still buy crap.My Grade : FDVD Extras : commentary Ted Mikels ; story make ( 9 and half minute ) ; 17 minute , 15 second scene footage ; Ted Mikels filmography ; and trailer " Worm Eaters " " Girl Gold Boots " , " Doll Squad " , " Ten Violent Women " ( feature nudity ) , " Blood Orgy she Devils " , & " Corpse Grinders "
Steven Seagal appear be sleepwalk dreadful movie shoot almost entirely close-up disguise complete lack budget and resource . pick technical flaw - silver F/A-18s and F-14s take carrier air-strike , and miraculously become camouflage F-16s actual strike - would give movie more credibility deserve . suffice say most interesting thing movie be credit title which fade and then disappear lightning wipe , which presumably be available user Final Cut Pro . put all your creativity your own credit put Michael Keusch same category Marcel Mandu .

" Lang 's role here be just opposite : perhaps bad trashy person film and character who fall love transvestite end film.Depressing , gloomy , semi-pornographic , repulsive : be just few adjective people use - even liberal critic - describe story , which be paint even bad novel . course , better-known critic , extreme lib , praise movie . however , be only one . most critic be disgust , as well almost all pay public . be unbelievable anyone could praise filth and garbage this.Trust : there be no good , likable character entire movie . be mean , sick film : one bad " modern era .

Peter Jackson wannabe come along and " do right " may as well keep re-reading tome . BTW , there be sequel book ( actually pre-quel ) call Allan 's wife . give background story Quatermain . be bit creepy but good .
be seriously one bad movie i have ever see . i love Japanese movie , and i think film same director , electric dragon 80,000 v , be masterpiece . i really want like movie - asano be terrific actor and storyline be immensely appealing . but i could n't find anything entertaining it.the movie take forever nothing happen . and effect director use - constant percussion and exorbitant use slow motion - merely add my grow annoyance fact plot be so mind-bogglingly slow and actor be heinously overact . lot boredom be result extraneous addition that be completely unnecessary - hour spend asano go slice buddha statue and proclaim how do n't worship anything . added nothing plot . fellow Japanese film buff and i be checking time constantly . could n't believe film be as terrible be . and finale be awful . i think director would least attempt reward viewer manage sit , but sadly i be mistake .

do n't get wrong , love action and revenge flick , have see many be kid , include Dolph Lundgren 's late " Mechanik " which be quite good . and Tony Scott certainly know how use camera and even might be genius shoot and edit films.But " Man Fire " ( and even more then " Domino " ) , Scott show rather use his film-making " genius " skill intelligently , use puposelessly show off and compensate lack substance his material do n't offer . " man Fire " be close 2 hour and half when really should have be least hour less.The way Scott shoot and edit film also make wonder really want ( audience ) sit his film his constant camera move and flash really be torture eye and make wanna leave theater or turn off 5 minute it.At time where MPAA and studio have questionable attitude regard rating , violence and make PG-13 movie , find also suspicious $70 million movie be make B-movie script character who cut finger , put bomb man 's ass and blow guy 's hand shotgun , all avenge death little girl who be N'T even dead ! go figure then why studio will pass good script language or violence ... thus say ...

Denver Pyle 's Uncle Jessie be also moral center family , always insist Boys do good , even their own expense or embarrassment make sandwich and coffee when chore be do . always do right thing and have sort earnest naivet that be quite appealing . want be more be , sorta . my favorite gimmick show be how always buckle their seat belt roar off , which be apparently too moral film.By transform Duke family pack leer , wisecrack , criminally mind , redneck bait , misogynistic loser movie have moral standpoint , where show be all about how honest or incorruptible Dukes be -- be Duke boy movie suppose come off good guy ? want punch both nose . seem have lot free time their hand that could be spend do chore back farm and end up pursue less noble end , notact pair 14 year old boy who have n't grow up . there should be marijuana use , no gawk buxom , nubile coed & their breast , shenanigan involve Brothers da Hood . look work marketing consultant who take poll mall what 14 year old boy like see movie . problem be 14 year old boy can possibly remember show , IMHO should n't be see movie either , and parent who might feel nostalgia show will be disgust what writer , director & producer do our collective memory just part our money , which be exactly how feel . what be thinking ? ? ? and boy do *EVER* get Daisy wrong . Jessica Simpson all dolled up Pamela Anderson mall slut may be only reason anyone see disgrace , but can service your need just fine downloading promotional still , print up & pin wall restroom . be hardly film ( which be movie 's only saving grace ) , and ten minute or so use be Still excessive . Catherine Bach 's Daisy may have have same kind short , and long leg that make people feel funny just look , but Daisy play be *PERSON* . pratfall elicit simply be who be have almost natural ring . remain one most outrageously sexy pop culture icon ever create but there be somebody home . and most importantly be sweet , caring person who could n't help guy go Ga Ga her.By contrast , Jessica Simpson appear phony , contrived , make up , costume , pose , aloof , bored , out place , and do n't think even look great outfit . do n't look person but plot device , conjure up deal someone represent her agent . Ms. Simpson would be well advise fire person immediately and pretend whole thing never even happen . whatever joke be , be n't and be disgracefully exploit T&A . ; that be want her career , executive produce sequel only ensure enough screen time least , effort be just pathetic.The bottom line be skip . cost two ticket and Slurpee go can pick up one Warner Bros. excellent box set collection original show DVD and entire family can watch together . be why work . only real purpose can see film might be be future use interrogation tool Guantanamo Bay . Twenty minute & will be sing choir.negative , and mean . and Stay THE HELL AWAY From THE BIONIC Man , schnook .
notice comment most people discuss movie be base their remark MST3K airing . be fair enough ( that be , , how get its wide exposure ) , but , have have misfortune see " Final Justice " its original form , will just like share few thought and comment uncut version.First off , must be admit original version be slightly more coherent MST3K broadcast , owe primarily expository scene Rossano Brazzi and Venantino Venantini ( I COULD use character ' name instead actor ' , but just love type word " Venantino Venantini " ) , explain why Venantini 's fugitive character ca n't just leave Malta right away . ( be notvery convincing plot point , but least filmmaker try cover . ) scene be cut just time or do n't provide much fodder riff , do n't know.Another plot point miss original : stripper 's betrayal Venantino Venantini Joe Don Baker , seemingly unmotivated MST3K version , be explain earlier , extremely unpleasant scene which Venantini rape shower . do give motive turn , whole scenario be just really ... icky . ( there be other word it.)Some MST-worthy moment ( perpetual truncated shout " Son -- " and " deja vu " shoot sheriff ) be purely result edited-for-TV print work , and be absent original movie.One scene wish have make MST3K version : enter bar question people , Joe Don ask Maltese policewoman accompany stay outside , " see uniform , wo n't cooperate . " however , Joe Don be wear his ridiculous cowboy-slash-sheriff outfit , complete shiny badge ! ca n't imagine why pass great opportunity make fun ... One final observation original , uncut version " Final Justice " : why , oh why , do feel need put Venantino Venantini 's naked butt up screen ?

Rajinikanth do well and Rajinikanth 's trademark style be actually enjoyable--"baba count " be novelty . what make movie unbearable be few initial minute be just preface bad book be ever write . even preface be punctuate comedy which be force and obvious.The director do n't explain purpose hero ; see hero be face several hurdle ( politician , as usual ) but ca n't really root hero do n't know what hero 's ultimate goal be . end , when everyone want be leader , hero give one his sermon and walk away become hermit . director offer solution problem climax scene.A . R. Rehman 's score be really interesting . either show patch brilliance or do n't bother invest fully movie--who can blame . there be one scene where Rajinikanth step van one crook and then throw knife and start his baba count . music be very apt moment and act catalyst add further tension . song be all mediocre , one would bother song movie few years.Unfortunately , 1 be low rank can assign IMDb . movie have all element that justify its rightful place nether IMDb 's ranking .
theory , ' Director 's Commentary ' should have work . talented Rob Bryden play Peter DeLane , former television director recount his experience camera . programme be allege have work are ' Bonanza ' , ' Flambards ' , ' Duchess Duke Street ' , and ' The Bounder ' . his commentary be notleast bit informative , due his habit wander off point.But practice , fail dismally . be one-joke show , and joke be notparticularly funny . script be completely lack wit , and Bryden fail convince old man . whenever stick anything amusing say , which be five second , issue hiss laugh . rather be amuse DeLane , want shoot . senile old man strike hilarious , then be you.It do n't help show mock be , exception ' Mr & Mrs ' and ' crossroad ' , rather good . joke work , need be really dreadful such ' Charlie 's Angels ' , ' O.T.T. ' , ' Telly Addicts ' , ' Neighbours ' , and ' New Faces'.The show tank big time , so thankfully be spare horror future edition . would n't be deliciously ironic ' Director 's Commentary ' be someday subject spoof ?
how can such good actor Jean Rochefort and Carole Bouquet could have be involve such ... ... well , such thing ? ca n't get . be awful , very baldy play ( but few lead role ) , joke be dumb and absolutely notfunny ... wo n't talk more movie , one little piece advice : do notgo see , will be waste time and money .
sixth grade , teacher have decide would be great idea make movie curriculum entire semester . class have something do terrible show . watch English and write journal be one character . math talk chart and other sea crap . science talk about whale ( which be actually somewhat interesting , so be n't 100 % waste time ) . day everyday be torture . notonly , but would subject horror twice day make watch study hall well . could see be new series or something , but be , like , ' 93 . be still try block out .
have give ' Kh Jik ' low score notbe bad movie , but do n't do anything worth praising.I have notsee Hsiao-hsien Hou 's work before , but uninitiated ( include ) ' Kh Jik ' be advertise homage Yasujiro Ozu . ( Japanese director whose last film be way , way 1962 ) film be extremely sparse work ... contain very little dialogue , story , music or emotion.Yo Hitoto play ' Yoko ' jobless , wandering character who spend her time her local coffee shop or loosely investigate Taiwanese composer like . Tadanobu Asano play her friend , who work cd shop and occasionally indulge his otaku interest train . and be about it.We watch Yoko drink coffee alone ... walk around ... wait train ... catch train ... fall asleep train . kind mundane reality anybody Japan can see daily basis . Hou capture ordinary moment character life , but meaning vignette be entirely pointless film make or watch .
do anyone read script . have be bad write and direct entire year . Three great actor , Paul Giamatti , Rachel Weisz and Miranda Richardson could n't pull one out . two-third look Giamatti eye be say , ca n't believe sign contract . be notbad movie ever see , but be really really bad Christmas movie list . notenough line , but what else can be say ? okay , movie just do n't move Vaughn 's con-man dialogue , his character be just creepy guy just ca n't get past . be just lackluster walk through , one seem be able get .

UGH !
be huge horror/splatter fan , even enjoy horror film people consider as stupid . also like gore . more merry long have point.After read other people 's review site be sure film be go be little gem . but much my disappointment prove be one most pointless film have ever watched.The acting be terrible , dialog be stupid , plot be pointless , special effect be useless and edit be probably do someone who have be dead past 2 year . usually i find all characteristic make great b horror movie . but notcase.I waisted 11 EUR get DVD.Unless actually enjoy pointless gore ( example " violent sh*t " film ) avoid cost !
have say there be nothing wrong low budget film , that be notmy problem . my problem be feel be watch my next door neighbor 's home movie . IMO everything just seem guy write out quick story , grab camera , and start shoot . understand how hard must be do effectively , but when pay rent film , expect feel be watch type professionally make movie.John Schneider have huge resume , be great actor , and be fine film . other people be not. understand how must be fun , and cheap use friend , and relative cast , but do n't make convincing acting . seem way be shoot , be try give many scene more interesting look , but when writing , plot , and acting be there begin , type style be n't necessary , and be distraction.Also technical level , have digital artifact all place . first scene fine car , when do slow scan , appear jerk back and forth just little bit . problem be n't my viewing equipment , ( Benq PE-8700 84 " diagonal ) but somewhere production . have never see kind artifact professionally make film before . then there be sound . sound do n't do voice-over , which may be o.k. sound track film . sound build microphone camera .

Beyond dirt cheap , shot-on-video exercise ineptitude be difficult get through . have get typical gore will expect zombie movie , but none require atmosphere make worth while.What be strange be be amateur German video , and version see be English-dubbed ! dubbers seem be American fan ( penpals Germans ? ! ) who ca n't decide want play straight or turn comedy . One character ( white German , course ) be dub black guy apparently , who speak thick ebonics ! ' Kno wahm sayin ' , Comrad ?
when be kid always use be babysit , and always use rent film or see film cinema . be one film watch . be one stupid film have ever see , think might even be Walt Disney Pictures film ! Martian be drop earth , turn human , befriend human , and be try everything can get back home . but be distract wonder earth . only good comment can give be choice actor , back Future 's Christopher Lloyd Martian , Uncle Martin , Dumb and Dumber 's Jeff Daniels Tim O'Hara , Elizabeth Hurley Brace Channing and Daryl Hannah Lizzie . but apart be complete crap .

British claymation series put " witty " conversation tape " average " people mouth " cute " fanciful creature least have advantage non-British viewer seeming droll and kind rarefied cultured humor could n't get U.S. television . someone make mistake put U.S. television.Sort sadly miscast American version sublime Brit-com COUPLING which die month NBC when same basic script do n't " translate " British English American English , what seem droll and cultured ( and just bit dull ) England , come CREATURE COMFORTS , American Version , simply boredom puppet . there be no plot-line , character and one and half episode watch ( three ultimately air ) , reason suffer more.The only positive thing be say new summer series and mercifully brief run have be claymation be least professionally do and come set-up single bad show CBS schedule , New Adventures Old Christine ( or " how be horrible mother - or person - one interminable , unfunny lesson " ) , kid who want stay up their bedtime happily run bed rather sit show , and adult could wait tune 9pm when " Two and Half Men " ( guilty pleasure ) and " how Met your Mother " ( actual quality writing ) come .
All funny thing happen sitcom be base main character Jim being either bad father , bad husband or generally just enormously selfish . how can that be funny ? course character sitcom have be flaw , but Jim 's character be flaw extremely unsympathetic manner.And why ? my guess be be " should now good " . Jim be notstupid guy , can take care thing and have get opportunity do so . but choose not. be conscious choice make , when choose notplay his kid , notgo shopping do n't want buy " lady product " and be choice make , when put down his relatives.The other character seem only be series Jim can have someone be jerk . Cheryl character be real person , would have leave year ago , and notstay deadbeat 8 year . but alas , be just catalyst Jim 's quirky middle-class extreme selfishness .
so be HBO " Made TV Movie " eh ? be excuse such pathetic plot and terrible act ? such shame see Jim Belushi reduce role so repetitive ( shoot , survive , lie , beat up , survive , shoot , lie and so ad infinitum . call script ? as brit , embarrass see Timothy Dalton be pathetic ( or be just take p*** , depend how much be pay guess ? ) attempt Southern Sheriff ) . as other Brit , bleach blond one , what w***er ! there be trend glorify " English speaking " ( sic ) super-violent thug lately , perhaps thanks Mr. Madonna 's two movie succeed entertaining and justify violence skillful use irony and humour , Pulp Fiction do . however , movie discredit and devalue genre . definately one miss .
what say movie . well be about bunch good student who have bad drug and turn delinquent student that sell more bad drug people .

Troma movie though , be bad movie there be out there . just watch one out morbid curiosity .
ludicrous and inept film be certainly most misguided version " Hamlet " ever reach screen . Branagh 's approach material can only be describe vulgar ; go such length depict Ophelia straight jacket , have Fortinbras ' army appear suddenly horizon ( look very much climax " Monty Python and Holy Grail " ) when palace be apparently guard only Francisco ( who shout very un-Shakespearean cry " ataaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack " be gun down ) , and multitude star cameo that harken back day Jimmy Cagney 's Bottom and Mary Pickford 's Kate.Branagh choose set his film Edwardian setting but same time decide employ almost uncut text , so frequently dialogue that be firmly root Elizabethan mentality make sense context be be perform . and Branagh do notconcern such textural subtlety ambiguous nature Hamlet and Olphelia 's relationship , treat audience vulgar nude sex scene couple that toss ambiguity right stain glass window.The uncut text do allow Branagh indulge his favorite cinematic pastime : more footage Kenneth Branagh . be never so apparent " how occasion Inform Me " speech that end first half nineteen hour film ( least be how feel ) , which attempt play dramatic crescendo line Gone Wind 's " will never be hungry again . " may serve Branagh 's ego , but do notserve Shakespeare or speech : when see film theater , lean over my companion and snicker " Great Moments Mr. Hamlet . " Branagh save funny and most tasteless moment last , when attempt out-do Olivier film and its justly celebrated death Claudius have Hamlet jump high tower monarch , impale sword . Branagh 's Dane do king heroically throw apparently magic rapier palace run Claudius ' heart super hero 's bull eye . only thing that save moment be unbearably maddening be be so off-the-wall funny.While film have be praise quarter serious depiction tragedy , be fact nothing but star-studded display once-talented filmmaker be overtake his own narcissism . Emperor have clothes , and Hamlet have nothing offer but few unintended laugh and appalling sight one man 's ego out control .
buzz film have always be fabulous graphics that make Kevin Bacon disappear . sadly , stop there . should have continue make script disappear , then silly set , and finally visible element film . because , there be nothing else there show.Gary Thompson and Andrew Marlowe be list write credit film . do n't really think exist . think buy script " Scripts-R-Us " , where buy standard blank " Monster Movie " script and just fill blank . there be monster stalk . let be split up . ( actually " let be split up " movie ) . hit Alien/Giant-bug/Monster/Invisible-man crowbar . notdead yet . Burn Huge-rabbit/Shark/Invisible-man unsurvivable fire . notdead yet . know , standard stuff . even minimum number element that be specific invisible man movie ( IR glass , spray something paint ) be handle badly.What be sad be there be lot possibility be fascinating movie . psychological issue subject , deterioration mind due process , treat invisible subject , and many other idea be touch on usually less 2 second and would have be far more interesting . have there be desire save Kevin Bacon end , would have be much good movie . , stunk.I would mention incredibly stupid element ending movie , but do n't want do spoiler . suffice say character be so stupid do n't think pull plug machine rather ...
Hanna-Barbera suck life out famous property . violence be water down , story be formulaic , animation be bad , music be obnoxious and repetitive , and frankly , show just be n't funny.At time , H-B put one its series same clichd situation , regardless fit world cartoon or not. thus , Popeye and Bluto appear recur segment caveman ( " Hey ! Popeye be popular , and Flinstones be popular . put ' em together , and ca n't miss ! " ) . also , apparent ripoff " Private Benjamin , " Olive Oyl and Goon have regular segment that feature new army recruit . seriously ! why ? add annoyance factor be public service announcement episode ( standard practice time cartoon , but still annoy ) .

piece ai n't really worth comment. . be simply bad " horror " movie i have ever see . actor be bad bad can be and whole plot be so silly nearly make cry . shame say ! !
last week , take look weekly Nielsen rating , and there be Veronica Mars , supposedly " good show be notwatching".Well , be right be notwatch . air twice and be rank 147 and 145 out 147.Translation : be lowest-rated show nationally broadcast network ... and deservedly so . try watch couple time all press coverage hyp " great " show , " realistic look " life and such nonsense . reality be otherwise . Veronica Mars be bore . be as unrealistic get , and richly deserve be canceled.The only Mystery be why CW feel compel put its inaugural schedule lowest-rated show memory , two year continued commercial and artistic failure .
movie be probably bad have see . bad acting , bad script , bad everything . compare mainly two other movie same genre and approximately same time be interesting . both Cyborg ( Van Damme , 1989 ) and Nemesis ( Olivier Gruner , 1993 ) be much well and seem more robust story and directing and still be Albert Pyun who have direct two as well ! story be notoriginal . world have become terrible place , possibly due environmental disaster or nuclear war , and people live medieval circumstance . special breed robot ( cyborgs ) live human blood and there be story ... cyborgs need get lot human fulfill there " prophecy " and human need someone stop . One girl together robot ( Kris Kristofferson ) build creator cyborgs have be appoint destiny save mankind.In movie director try Hong-Kong stylish fighting scene participant fly high and leap far . movie fail miserably attempt.I recommend film only reason most people will get new " worst ever " movie relate . and fan genre recommend " Cyborg " think be very underestimate movie quite high entertaining factor . and ca n't stand Van Damme then check out " Nemesis".I rate movie negative .
contrary its title , film offer spice and thus audience be subject tasteless dish . Humor appear forced , theatrical , mechanical , stage , reminiscent Pakistani play available video , include even mannerism . everybody be scream , shout and do odd thing reason . premise look interesting be straight lift Hollywood 's ' Boeing Boeing " . John Abraham who be so natural almost all his film be complete misfit here . keep morality factor aside , even then bizarre event look trite . Akshay Kumar and Paresh Rawal , two experienced stalwart try hard lift film be natural but vain . least , character three girl should be make contrast order bring interesting element but sadly here too all appear brainless , buxomed bimbettes ( 3Bs ) who talk , behave and even scream quite similar fashion . major hole plot be what make protagonist keep three girl his same home pretend will never get know other ? just do sex , what else ? same could be do hundred other way . therefore so much dramabaazi reason be notsomething audience will digest easily . but surely , great flesh show and tempting promo always give such film great initial . now who call situational comedy , call pathetic taste . sense humor such cinema go audience be surely go corrupt and dement extent be connect sadistic , weird and maddening type humor , where be notcharacter laugh but rather and their own frustration that look how senseless have become order laugh have bear such thing ?
movie be blatant attempt left Hollywood portray Reagan 's administration incompetent and bungling . mistake may have be make time crisis , but be sure notextent portray lame movie . my first reaction be movie have have be direct Oliver Stone , but be wrong time . there be apparently many other .
@card@ 10.This be kind movie cant believe just waste 2 hour your life see credit role . honestly think could make good Vampire movie ... . and know nothing . only thing that do notjust suck ( hard Vampire ) be Jason Scott Lee ... . his character be least little bit cool , have mystery , and kick little butt .
drama its very core , " Anna " display genuine truth actor age , and sometimes , fade away . Anna be character that believe America be her safety net , her home , and can do her no wrong but refuse belittle do work do n't believe . be hard-nosed , optimistic , stubborn , and arrogant when come her life , yet notafraid let other , yet drop moment notice . Anna flip-flop personality , which make film ideal age star , but notidea viewing audience . " Anna " have be praise its star Sally Kirkland , and her ability get " grungy " role , but month 2008 , " Anna " do notremain staple film culture . be dated , dull , and formulaically chaotic.Director Yurek Bogayevicz have message hide " Anna " falsehood Czechoslovakia , both politically and socially , but Kirkland refuse let upstage . Bogayevicz be notafraid play camera , use wooden frame allow Kirkland stand out , and be notafraid lessen surround character so when walk away film , be Kirkland remember . be n't obvious , film do n't sit well . opening first act and deep second , " Anna " feel high school theater production . character be non-existent , there be enlightening pre-story , and there be definition time or place . there be Sally Kirkland , stubbornly say be good other actress vie same lifestyle want . randomly encounter friend , young girl that have also travel long distance get America glitz and glamour , and two ( span 20 minute ) build friendship that could break wall . be emotionally boring and unbelievable . again , randomly , meet Anna 's boyfriend Daniel ( play weak Robert Fields ) , who bring nothing table term definition or character only boost attention Kirkland 's Anna . course nearly two hour , watch as more random act couple unnamed character intertwine together feebly create story that be hold together loose thread and Sally Kirkland . Arg , pain continue say but " Anna " could have be fantastic film have Bogayevicz present equal time Anna , Daniel , and Krystina , but instead be force one-sided game where emotional scene speak louder plot.Is where Charlize Theron find inspiration her beauty-less role " Monster " , or Halle Berry " Monster 's Ball " ? be Sally Kirkland one early actress discover let go character Oscar will shine their direction ? film be disgust Kirkland 's portrayal Anna , and Bogayevicz 's lack excitement anything else fluent . Bogayevicz give Anna that do n't work hard her part , do n't care other , and be generally mean spirited yet be feel sympathy ? beginning film , force what want do other , and get upset when do n't get her way . sure , aging actress my have appeal , but Kirkland create more childish character instead mature one . be where " Anna " could have improve . be mature Kirkland , would have gobble up , but stammer childish Anna be impossible believe . my favorite scene be end where Anna go watch one her old film playing ( include be absurd make-out character ) and film burn , scene be also one my least favorite . Anna have make phenomenal life , create film and build dream , yet when anyone else want enter spotlight , get jealous and outraged . do n't make character want stand behind nor win Oscar . couple classic 80s background synthesizer , outrageous over-the top wardrobe , and displace ending ( where do come and what happen ? ? ) " Anna " slip far scope amazing cinema . be show-piece , opportunity age star yell world one more time . one work , but do n't think will be fool again.Overall , can say be impress film . " Anna " be notfilm age film star ; be about Sally Kirkland , and ONLY Sally Kirkland . Bogayevicz try do more story , but fail either Kirkland will notallow or just realize there be n't enough support full story . there be one or two decent scene film , but nothing that promote film innovative or influential . Bogayevicz do notcreate character audience would believe , tear up , or dedicate Sunday afternoon create annoyance . Kirkland be n't Anna , be actress play bit overdo and crusty side . perhaps miss scope film , but what make film work be cooperation everyone involve . be n't case here . " Anna " , Kirkland order Daniel act dog ( apparently symbolic act ) and yet entire emotional scene , could n't help but think be what Kirkland be like set . do n't make film , transform her own production , and " Anna " fail . can suggest anyone one Czech skip ! grade : * out ***** ( pesky theater scene that creeped out )
This be shadow doubt absolute bad movie Steven Seagal have ever make . and say lot . do n't get fool rating , be way too good . abomination have n't even be worthy negative rating , such thing existed.- absolutely plot- Worst action scene ever , and there be n't too many either- Seagal do n't do anything , include fighting , talk ( lot dubbing ) , and so . always.- Seagal be fat , lazy and could n't care less movie . something which be very obvious all way throughTake all other garbage DTV movie Seagal have make , multiply other , multiply thousand billion , and all badness then get wo n't even describe 1 % absolute crapfest .

movie use cut edge title lame story . Kill Kill , would have be nice . movie incorporate taboo scene make viewer move back their chair . scene be unnecessary and choppy . movie be something novice screen writer could have conjure . just waste movie prop and network money . have write 10 line text critique film when be notworth 10 line my time , but have push let people know avoid nonsense . people be count choose good movie movie night , pick something else . have soul do n't damage subject filth .
plot sound have promise . be honest do notwatch entire movie . about hour movie have make decision . be movie worth watch conclusion ? answer be clearly No ! be notfact human body could notreceive transplant different species reject . nor premise be be chase secret government authority human / wolf transplant . be movie be badly write , act lack emotion and do notunderstand several dream sequence wolf and buffalo . when be run zoo dog pack and leave front zoo gate say " ca n't run big dog do n't leave porch " keep run my bored mind . save time and skip movie . can guarantee do dare watch will sit there slack jaw do wonder why anyone waste money , time , energy and effort make insulting outrage American cinema .
film be totally garbage . imbecilic intellectual comfort make all his good claim superiority aristocrat work class . nothing more piece self-complacence catharsis . Disgusting.If kind movie be set US , will sure make big joke . and simply come out ' other side ' , make masterpiece , wonderful amusement certain brain-washed and/or brain-washing western ( George W. maybe : ) . typical cold-war sequela , kind joke anyway.I would say , -- express film -- be all what Soviet intellectual have be think all year , then maybe deserve all misery claim have go through . but No ! ' cause many other , have read and watch real masterpiece make real outstanding Soviet intellectual . example , something also relevant dog , " White Bim Black Ear " -- both Gavriil Troyepolsky 's book and Stanislav Rostotsky 's movie -- be real masterpiece . real life , real tragedy , real sad , real pride and dignity , one real good Soviet era .
know , go see " Hills have eye 2 " want like . really enjoy original , and remake be fairly entertaining . obviously have more money throw around Wes Craven do special effect second time around . even still prefer original film , remake be do well , and be kind guilty pleasure . bloody , intense , and great special effect . short , great popcorn movie horror fan.Which bring " Hills have eye 2 " . man , where do start ? plot , or lack one , be paper thin . be notexactly break new ground here.The military have decide monitor area , and people turn up miss . so what do do now ? let be send National Guard investigate . true Hollywood fashion need make dumb , and bad soldier ever see . Gee , have never see premise before . make long story short , have mutant kill off moron soldier one time graphic fashion . once again special effect Nicotero be great , but kill matter how graphic become boring , and predictable . honestly seem flick be do just grab quick buck . be bloody , and graphic , but find predictable , boring , and notscary . would have be nice film contain one original thought.Wes Craven and his son share write duty , and have be involve many my favorite horror film , but sadly be n't one .
Holy crap . be bad film have see long time . all performance be fine , but there be plot . really ! plot ! bunch clown talk and and be your film . Ug ... Robert Duvall 's character be senile and keep ask same people same qestions over and over . earn same response over and over . be pretty sure film get upto six people think should like . good performance famous and well regard actor , but actual complete work be steamy turd . well , maybe be bit deceptive steam rise fresh pile sound little like something happen and film Nothing HAPPENS !

begin nice note only falter quickly and let down expectations.Mac ( Akshay Kumar ) and Sam 's ( John Abraham ) character be notproperly build Mac 's boss decide hitch three air hostess . rest drama be about how Mac , Sam and Uncle Mambo ( Paresh Rawal ) deal situation which time seem forced.About cast , Paresh Rawal be very talented actor , think be waste role moody cook . Akshay Kumar be tolerable , John Abraham be very bad keep stumble furniture & Rajpal Yadav be only saving grace movie.The second half movie be funny time , but all Dud ( song be bore ) and major let down be hope wholesome entertainment and comedy .
Okay ... i have see lot really odd/unusual movie my day . fear and loathing Las Vegas come mind when think . well notanymore ... here out , whenever someone ask , " hey , what be most unusual movie have ever see ? " slipstream be what i will say ! and do notmean " unusual " good way.From very beginning movie , be obvious be go be one " trippy camera effect " movie . that mean , little thing flash image screen , rewind and fast-forwarding people 's word and scene , mess color screen , flash forward and flash back constantly ... then have actual act . people randomly get violent , shoot things/people , say weird thing that just do n't make much , sense.The movie be about writer who start intermingle real life book be write and lack good way explain , basically see " trip " go movie . thing be , Johnny Depp go similar trip Fear and Loathing Las Vegas but only difference be his trip be entertaining watch , notpainful ! honestly , have real hard time even finish Slipstream . kind hurt my brain bit.I can see film buff make claim as movie have certain cinematic nuance that make notonly unique but add feeling dementia ... blah , blah , blah . point be , movie hurt your brain when watch ... .it make very little sense , take your concentration even remotely try and understand what be go on and even end , only thing can be happy about be be over ... and can say actually sit ! so closing , want see movie that will have say " what heck " and again both out loud and your head , go ahead and waste hour and 30 minute and check out.Mr Hopkins , applaud actor and commend your choice take stab directing ... .please , do notever make movie again . next time , try something that rely little more great storytelling camera technique that tend leave viewer headache .

Well , can honestly say be first time experience film that have literally meat or potato . entire film feel be just salad main course . story line be fallible and laughable , character be one-dimensional , realism be window , and animation be do four-year old . do that cover ? have never be more embarrass concept my entire life . have never read comic or see other program character , but look other review be notoff base my observation.To begin , story move too quickly . someone new character and situation , need more build create reason instead find solution . have see other Anime ( could call one Anime ) that do great thing their character take time develop . there be nothing set aside Lady Death . few short scene , see her train cremator and instantly become aggressive she-beast Hell . be hard swallow , consider moment be introduce weak and feeble woman control her father . suddenly , be immerse hatred and can do battle existence that have be around million year . be absurd . presentation Lady Death be poor , say least . feel as be nothing more animated character instead desperate woman revenge mind . , just do n't work . be nothing more eye-candy prepubescent boy want ogle mass quantity skin suddenly grow her chest when training Cremator . oh , feel sick just watch . same go character Cremator . who be random person ? explanation give be n't enough , and instead be leave more incoherent babble actual development . be very sad day Hell when forgo character show more violence and action , especially animated feature.Next , there be Lucifer . let just say think could do battle king Hell and survive . be weak , his voice be laughable , and just do n't represent image have my mind . be as Disney be control and want make semi-PC . lack darkness and corrupt nature Lucifer embody . be notruler Hell , but instead just lackey that have big place live . speak live or die , how can die again Hell ? be concept that definitely need more explanation . most character be worry die , when do n't even consider option be already dead . be how get Hell . think be level think ruin film . do n't quite capture notion your soul be still solid body Hell , but that could just be or maybe be there be No Development story . there be nothing build , just preparing.The battle sequence be hysterically bad . animation cartoon feel be make early 90s . there be nothing impressive way film be draw . why be , America , so animation ? be huge Asia , and be creep hardcore here keep make film Lady Death that do notchallenge or use part imagination . be cheap , and film show it.Overall , film be bad . animation couple horrendous voice work be cheap . have head somewhere film production long time , which be hard understand think could have make film my credit card . production be horrendous as well story . nothing be develop , leave huge gape plot hole nearly everyone fall . strength character be miss , and nothing be explain . waste my time one and would like warn other so when death do come , do n't find my state and regret fact waste 80 minute piece garbage.BLAH ! grade : * out *****

Oh man , what be Sam Mraovich thinking ? what be anyone who be involve " film " think ? Mraovich be head nearly everything " Ben and Arthur " : Director , writer , producer ( also executive producer ! ) , caster , lead star- name , do . and ( Mraovich ) suck more anyone have ever suck department film making.So what be wrong film ? everything . film be about two gay lover , Ben ( Jamie Brett Gabel ) and Arthur ( Mraovich- *groan* ) . Ben and Arthur want get married world where everyone basically hate gay people . make thing worse , Ben 's crazy " ex-wife " ( do n't exactly divorce ) , Tammy ( Julie Belknap ) be steam mad Ben have leave man and demand Ben get back together ( say can be gay , too ! ) and Arthur 's Christian devoted , excessively hypocritical , equally batty Tammy brother , Victor , be hell bend make Arthur turn straight and then try kill get kick out his church.The film be absolutely chock block so many goof ( Ie . Ben and Arthur fly Vermont get married- go there Alaska Airlines and Vermont have palm tree ; fly back FedEx cargo plane- hope be comfy wooden crate , plus many , many more ) and plot hole boot ( Victor call kill Arthur " final plan " which late change " Final Deed " ; Arthur and private ( intern ) detective drive same car , blah , blah , blah ) . " actor " be all very bad and be way , way top ; script be laughably horrible(one such example be " do n't make sense ? do n't make sense ! make sense , that be who make sense ! " ) and there so much more wrong " movie " ca n't write down.However , most laughable yet unbelievable thing " Ben and Arthur " be Sam Mraovich think have create something that be truly fantastic ( see his fake review " Ben & Arthur " and obvious comment YouTube . ) . Mraovich be narcissistic and his arrogance blind see how awful anything his name really is.So , conclude , forget bad film claim be bad movie ever- " Ben and Arthur " will knock right title , even Paris Hilton movie look " Dark Knight " compare monstrosity know " Ben and Arthur " .

Edel miss opportunity enrich character development notexplore character 's motivation , and avoid develop character 's personality its full extent.This lack character development be blatant Tralala . Jennifer Jason Leight do great job play trashy prostitute , but her alcohol-induced decision let sailor violate be notexplain . look extremely stupid , see character do out blue . be clear example poor character development.The movie also have many secondary , token character that do nothing , feel nothing , and add nothing plot . would have like learn more Harry 's wife , instance , and interaction two . be miss opportunity.Edel only approach character development Harry and his fixation his gay lover , only screw up end , notclearly explain -again- his motivation . thug be also joke their lack development.- soundtrack be one bad have ever experience . terrible job Mark Knopfler . seriously expect more former leader Dire Straits , but his job movie be seriously lack . time , battle union worker and police , music seem totally disconnect movie . also feel completely poor and anachronic ; could swear whole soundtrack be make Casio toy keyboard . distract actual action.- book adaptation Desmond Nakano be so literal that eliminate point story . feel as try so hard keep action-by-action storyline book , that forget actually develop character and , once again , explain their action and motivations.I seriously can notrecommend movie , noteven Shelby fan , can ruin original book . be very uninspired effort adapt novel , and show very little creative input .

First must stress how rare be take time comment movie have see , take very special case take time and write about how feel film . say , hundred movie have watch have see most brilliant , Shawshank , scary , Woman Black , funny , Shark Attack III : Megaladon , and now bad : vampire Zombies.The first thing that must be say be movie be notfunny ! that be look light heart movie that will just be fun or very least so bad be funny , look elsewhere . be true movie such be nottry be subtle and brilliant , title such should know what be get . say , there be excuse movie abandon and rule that govern movie make world . be notargument traditional movie make process and new and more " artsy " method create film , be argument bad director and company be hold accountable make terrible movies.This movie suffer over use say " do n't know where start . " truly everything movie be break . acting and edit there be reason movie should ever fail deliver cohesive series event such Vampires vs. Zombies . follow problem be ; 1 . scene misfires- be clear director , camera crew and actor be notsame page . one scene particular scene begin camera rest ground look passenger side door car . be expect person inside get out , but there be , and be No exaggeration , 10 second , least , delay camera come and director say " action " where anything happen screen . viewer be left stare car door entire time sound , movement , just stereotypical " dead air " radio or TV commentator dread . where be edit ? 2 . Acting- forgivable offense most case , ca n't expect movie have Oscar winner , but Vampires vs. Zombies take bad act whole other level . " actor " be barely able read their script obviously anyone ability read and speak would have be able pronounce line well fool . my only comparison act would have be opening scene Resident Evil Playstation . but act be even better.3- Story- Wait , what ? story ? again ca n't expect be Greatest Story ever told , but be too much ask have semblance narrative ? why Vampires ? who be character ? who be bad guy ? be there good guy ? why all lesbian ? but most importantly , what be deal zombie ? have see movie then will understand what mean , but who have n't will be plain , there be zombie movie aside maybe five minute . be almost as director forget name movie and be force throw zombie explanation very end.There be so much more , but hope have do enough keep anyone see movie .

This be dumb movie . maybe my judgment would n't be so harsh film do n't promise so much , but just feel movie cheat and play fool turn.I do n't have beef acting , but think character be awful . movie start off Clive Owen 's character tell what criminal mastermind be , and how plan perfect bank robbery , something frequently remind later . oh yeah , also tell be prison cell , that turn out be dumb metaphor . idiot know good bank robbery be one where minimum number thing could potentially go wrong , and be long go police show up . but Clive Owen 's scheme require hang around bank hour - reason but stalk around and look scary as far can tell . also have control hostage , negotiate cop , and most fantastically , perform This-Old-House job bank 's stockroom and hide out there week ( hope bring enough food , and bucket pee ) and then sneak out again . yeah , sure sound perfect crime , Clive ! plan have so many move part only reason do n't fall apart be screenwriter say so.And then there be many unexplained detail : why be cop so convinced crook have accomplice hostage ? who hell be Jodie Foster 's character , and why be so important have mayor her beck and call and do n't have tell Denzel Washington her agenda " be his pay scale ? " how dumb be cop ca n't figure out one guy speaking foreign language hour be notsound criminal gang plan robbery ? how do robber slip away , and why do Clive Owen stick around week ? how do find out bank chairman be past , and number and content his safe deposit box ? why hell would Clive Owen let Jodie Foster or cop ? since when do make toy AK-47s that look real up close ? how hell do bug pizza box , anyway ? how do Clive Owen manage sneak out secure area bank work hour , undetected ? do dispassionate criminal really feel bond enough cop Denzel slip diamond ? none question be ever answer . there be film that achieve depth leave wonder event that happen off-screen , but never feel way Inside Man . feel scene that explain thing be cut movie , or question never have answer first place , and that be weak . particularly annoy be Jodie Foster 's character , who wo n't disclose what do , but never seem tire remind how important be . be just suppose take her word , guess.The only reason give movie two star be laugh Denzel 's " taxi cab " and " pina colada " gag , and kid 's outrageous video game . other , movie have redeeming feature .

( gasp ! ) time around , ape squirm groan-worthy dialogue , nonsensical plot , and showy special effect that constantly reinforce my mind money could have be put about 10 independent film that would have be consider ' masterpiece ' next tripe.As much enjoy superb acting talent that be Tim Roth , his performance evil ape leader Thade be nothing more intense composition slouch and heavy breathing . luckily , makeup allow actor maintain dignity and most crap-dialogue be hide his groan and sniffles.And alas , always dependable Hollywood tradition take male and female lead and hook up end relationship development or cause . and " haha , be so clever , be n't ? " way Hollywood intermingle reference original POTA one . sigh ... instead see , spend night and call up friend and rent ' Ed Wood ' , ' Edward Scissorhands ' , ' Batman ' , or even lesser extent ' Sleepy Hollow ' , and reminisce day when Tim Burton be man vision and originality ... notshame and ridicule .

Hispanic , be highly offend show and way character be portrayed.Plus dysfunctional family thing have be do death . once , want see something original . what make show funny when other show have do million time ? think ABC would come its sense and pull piece garbage air , but sadly , be go have stomach " jump shark".In my opinion , already do .

Salvage be bad so call horror film have ever see . there be nothing remotely horrific . do n't deserve be genre fine . first i do n't see how so many people can think piece crap such great movie . write something boring and utterly ridiculous i would be laugh and too embarrassed subject other stupidity . second : acting be terrible and lead actress be excruciatingly ugly . third : story suck , its be use , and excuse its cheap movie be excuse . read summery back case , reveal whole story . do notrecommend watch movie have 80 minute waste something that will leave regret watch . feel really bad Crook and irony their name . hail Anthony Perkins ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

Paul Rudd be only one that have talent , and only one that be notannoy . have never watch Desparte Housewives , so do n't know how Eva Longoria be show , but movie be horrible . be know nothing act . all her character do be whine film , and ca n't pull off be b**** and still be entertaining . and other girl , Lake Bell , display little emotion and be be look cue card read them.As story , be so cookie cutter . go point A B little surprise . so much more could have be use Kate ghost . plot should have revolve more and thing do spirit.FINAL verdict : be notworth watching .
suppose many people comment/review their first movie IMDb movie be spectacular or horrible -- be write due latter.I be excite sequel " Wargames " . . think original be quite good consider its time period and content , feel be worth watch more once . be 2008 , have high hope what would do film . computer , Gaming , Terror , military over-zealousness have all grow so much time first film , and " Wargames : Dead Code " have opportunity bring all great flick.The movie fail pretty much level , but particularly blame writer and anyone who have input regard realism gaming aspect . " Dead Code " be 1990 's air flight simulator few people ground wave their arm . meanwhile , Will Farmer be button mash about 7,000 command -- none which be impact what be happen screen . finally " win " click box screen his mouse release gas that instantly kill 20,000 virtual people ( nobody be gas ) . beat 5 Levels 15 minute , tell Ripley ( real life war machine ) be high level terror threat.Even 5-16 year old could complete same task - government believe be lethal threat humanity . say thing " have expert knowledge bio-terror " ... display less knowledge someone who read first 3 paragraph Wiki entry Bio-Terror . so then movie-long chase scene about .01 % budget and excitement Bourne title ensue . have about 1000 opportunity catch and clear up entire matter. . sometimes be mad barely miss him. . but other time masterfully create opportunity just let go intentionally follow him.Ugh ... would write more. . but already waste 1.5 hour watch , would rather watch Broderick and Joshua play tic-tac-toe 1.5 hour .

First would like point out film have absolutely nothing see Dutch folklore story ghost ship that be also call Flying DUTCHMAN . film , will notsee single sailing boat . will notsee sailor , ghost , or anything remotely exciting . be notstory ghost ship , and wish have notify main credit or would n't have watch , really think be film legend . seem many people think film have do legend ghost ship , film be list Wikipedia page " Flying Dutchman " legend ... do n't understand why . be maybe base resemble legend call " Wandering Jew " ? or maybe do just adapt bad part legend ? film begin fight sequence that would let anyone hope film will have battle scene . unfortunately , be only battle scene film . then see Daniel Emilfork ( who be Krank City Lost Children ) about two second , and that would let anyone hope film will have good acting . unfortunately be very bad film . same thing can be say Italian actor Nino Manfredi , who be one Italia 's good actor ever , and who here be condemn embody crazy bird wrangler back story whose only purpose be seem be " wise man " film . and boy , do film need wiseness ! other character story seem enjoy swimming excrement , yell , torture other ( excrement ) , fornicate ( excrement ) or lay excrement more just fun . seem be such fun character story get have his or her turn be dump feces point or . come Dutch director , might think extreme dirtiness and shockingly real filth be necessary element period piece , element which contribute make Dutch filmmaker Paul Verhoeven 's film , " Flesh + Blood " , such great film . thought " Flesh + Blood " would let anyone hope film similarly filthy and visually straight-forward would be good . unfortunately , and " Flesh + Blood " , there be dramatic progression , fight , good acting , and put simply , " Flesh and Blood " . photography , opening sequence unfold , be well-done and entice . too , stop very early film . music , Nicola Piovani ( " La vit e bella " fame ) be repetitive and annoy , when notirrelevant ( sometimes imply there be grandeur sequence , screen actor be splash liquid dung ) . first " act " film , which last nothing less hour ( ! ) , film take place same perimeter , which be around farm where main character live . character play excrement lot , drown , play . long period time elapse numerous ellipse allow main character , young boy who love play excrement , become old and play excrement more . bird-man talk lot say foolish thing Italian . Spanish conquistador speak French . nothing make sense . everything be confuse and take hour happen . then there be second act call " Ship " , which see what might have be ship , long time ago , but which be now remain ship ( cover excrement do mention ? ) . main character , walk bit further away farm , just happen run , and decide be really cool so let be live . hunchback who live before be try kill , but do n't really mind ( do mention ? ) be notvery bright . think ship can navigate and hope sail , more conquistador show up ( least seem be conquistador Don Quixote style hat but as have say be really confuse who be who ) , make Dutchman prisoner , along retarded hunchback , and burn ship ground . last part film , which be really hard bear spectator just consist even more excrement even more retarded middle-age peasant fight , take place mad asylum . yet more torture and drown other feces . yet more loiter director , who seem have definitely give up his job , or pass second crew camera assistant do rest job . end , lot mentally-challenged new " friend " Dutchman make die . woman have sex who be his brother 's wife begin try have meet his son . Dutchman and his son talk . film end two hour dungy image and calamitous acting and technical performance . then credit roll and spectator fell immensely free have watch atrocious film plot pretend be something exciting fantasy film base legend , be nothing but mere catalog how full excrement film can get when do n't have enough financing power put battle instead or even horse .
First , little summary . reporter name torch be basically try get out story zombie outbreak and find military & government censor . nice message , government censorship and all , but way DID movie be , well let explain.This movie be description . idea somebody hold high regard anything George Romero be justification enough reviewer be commit mental institution . script be atrocious its own , be write sixth grader.As special effect , understand independent film have low budget , and gore effect look acceptable , but want scene fire , here be tip : buy nonflammable material , have extinguisher ready , and get fire go ! do n't digitally add in and make look explosion Nintendo 64 game . acting , well let be put way . my summer theater program , cold reading script be , compare , Godfather . wo n't even go inconsistency . find yourself.What disturb most , though , be when everything be finish shoot and edit , somebody might have say , " Okay , look good . let be release . " send chill my spine even think , think somebody feel be good enough DVD release . be n't DVD quality . be n't Sci-Fi channel quality . hell , be n't even film school quality . be submit project film school , would get F. No , noteven F , more F- . would n't be surprise would try get expelled.I feel use see thing . Blockbuster and maker movie have my money right now , and will prefer notthink what be do . have be pawn elaborate , nefarious scheme legalize theft , and do n't feel good think walk right , look back cover pleasant memory 28 day Later only find film Ed Wood would watch and say afterwards , " do n't much care . " film be single most terrible movie have see . have notsee anything Ed Wood , but have confidence be bad . be look serious cinema , so much be ten foot will probably give bad headache . not, still recommend personally write director and ask how sleep night . however , be kind person who get laugh out really bad stuff then recommend check out . wo n't be disappoint .
ca n't believe praise movie herein be n't think other film . be prepare possibility would be awful , but script ( or lack thereof ) make film that be also pointless . plus side , general level craft part actor and technical crew be quite competent , but when have get sow 's ear work ca n't make silk purse . Ben G fan should stick just other movie have be . Dorothy S fan should stick Galaxina . Peter B fan should stick last Picture Show and Target . fan cheap laugh expense who seem be ask should stick Peter B 's amazingly awful book , Killing Unicorn .
This be bad show . Buntch grow up act kid humor nothing . even Sesame Street have good humor and more adult friend " friend " may be bad thing have ever see television and have be sit front tube observe friend " simply do notstack up well other , contemporary series . lack smartness " Seinfeld " and wonderful self-ridicule pomposity that be hallmark " Frasier " . character " friend " seem design make repellant dullard . incestuous group neighbor make my flesh crawl.The unintelligent show be completely edge sort . character be caricature caricature and writing be sophomoric -- though intentionally so . ( might be interesting observe write session writer may have slave aim low their capability so as notconfuse loyal friend " friend " . )

as far can understand , TIW Watcher be first work young director . my doubt be be work regular guy who happen love film or be work cinema student , there be reference Oporto School Art final credits.Nevertheless , director Ricardo Pinho demonstrate movie total unawareness basic notion cinema . what be movie ? how tell story ? do n't matter , novice director . One first thing learn school when be study cinema be how tell story . learn , just novel , movie should also construct your story three act : introduction , development and conclusion . learn your story should have protagonist and antagonist and there should be climax . learn be valid 3-hour-epic , regular movie , short film and even , believe or not, 30-second commercial . also learn there can be level subtleness your approach academic structure and , ultimately , can even deconstruct it.In rough term , Tim Watcher introduce its main character and then , movie end - whole movie sound introduction character Jeunet 's AMLIE . there be no second or third act Tim Watcher . be notparody or art film , thus ca n't even try justify disrespect academic structure . be expect be tell story , and do n't happen . bad , Tim Watcher define warning ; and one real purpose . do n't make point , or least , notvalid one . its point be childish , sense vengeance . situation portray be utterly simple and its approach be Manichaean.I be expect lot more short . movie open rather good-looking credit sequence and quickly realize be watch something good production value regular Portuguese short film . do n't know budget movie , but judge thanks-list end credit , merit must go production team such good connection country where be difficult have door open young filmmakers.TIM Watcher seem be exercise style , color and carefully choose plan , combine fine score . be all . there be nothing else . there be plot . and be shame feel waste production value . hardly , can see regular Portuguese short such diversity location and so many available extra enrich story.As absurd comparison may sound , must refer BMW short fine example how can tell good story very short film severely condition product placement and over-the-top stylish cinematography .
watch first 15 minute , think be real documentary ( irritatingly overly dramatic " camera " producer).When realize be stage think " why would want waste my time watch junk ? ? " so turn off and come online warn other people . character do n't act believable way . too much immature emotion . guy travel way world war torn country , act kid . and do n't believe be " his character be so upset trade center bombings".very trite and stupid.have see " city lost child " ? French dark fantasy film guy who kidnap kid and steal their dream ... like !
have figure when star 's name be list wrong opening credit , be notgood time ( credit read " Cuba Gooding , J.R. " ) . nice car chase , shoot ' em up , blow ' em action ALL want be action , relationship what plot exist be tenuous good , and completely unbelievable . motivation character , especially Gooding 's end , be bad then unbelievable , be irrational when be nothopelessly muddle . all can think be Andy Cheng must be really nice guy get many good actor foul project ( ca n't have something , can ? ) .
just watch movie Starz . let go few thing i thought could have be improve ; acting , write , direct , special effect , camera crew , sound , and lighting . also seem as writer have idea anything that have do movie . apparently back 2007 , when dollar be strong could buy super advanced stealth bomber that could go completely invisible $75 million . Now-a-days thing cost $3 billion and cant go invisible . apparently can fly US middle east hour . there be completely random lesbian scene , which do n't mind , but seem lame attempt get more guy see . camera would randomly zoom actor and skip random scene . oh yeah , its Steven Segal movie , its predictable hell . rank right up there Snakes Plane .
be still try figure out there be point film.For content that be suppose be so ' rebellious ' and ' controversial ' thing that Maddox distribute student be awfully lame . student seem be easily sway vague anti-authoritarian sentiment and snippet word illegibly scrawl leaflet . rebel , everybody.I suppose would have be too much ask have teenage rebellion film where school fire alarm do n't get set off.Apparently ' huge fight up football field ' be fight that consist two people.Characters personality seem wildly vary random . football jock who Maddox be fight ( and who subsequently get staple face ) be smile and apology next day.The fact do n't come real conclusion plot make feel whole thing could have be fit half hour school special . have cut most attempted pseudo-glitch soundtrack .
well reason see cinema be be sneak preview , else would never have see terrible teenage slasher movie . mean have n't have enough yet ? scream and Scary Movie least do nottake self serious ! plot suck , and acting be bad have see . ( only Godzilla can compare , which be also only movie that compete be bad have see cinema one.)There be so many plot hole story , and girl be so alike , do n't even now who have be kill , and who have not. ( and do n't care . ) only know advance be Denise , and be most talent less actress have ever see bad excuse movie.Stay far away movie possible . ( negative )

much bad original . be actually *painful* sit through , and barely hold my six year old be interest.Introduction new Pokemon be marginally interesting , but storyline be extra-thin , dialogue be still bad , and music be mediocre . watch television show instead - be much good .
 Yes , be lucky enough see long-running original production Michael Bennett 's hit musical . be amazing experience and pay see movie when hit theatre back 1985 . be awful . almost everything fail . first off , Attenborough ( fine actor , good director right material ) be sorry choice - almost as bad when John Huston be hire mangle Annie . camera be always wrong place - chop up song and CASTING ! ! ! be awful - power play be dancer - hungry , talented performer just want chance show what could do and when get their chance - could n't take your eye off . but cast just get dancing , do " nice " job singing but none spark one bit . fact , look up cast IMDb - none really go on do anything much . ( OK , OK , Janet Jones married Gretzky - sheesh ) . cinema trainwreck do notcapture one second magic , desperation , passion stage musical . total strike-out ! ( but even try smother music - great music still rise up time and remind people how great score be ) .
geez , Gay man who live NYC can gratefully say have never see underbelly Gay Culture that be portray film - and be glad ! ! ! be film broadcast TV United States there would be great anti-Gay backlash and can say would blame . people film do notrepresent average Gay American or even average Trandgender American , what do represent be sheer and utter nightmare . inclusion obviously underage character be appalling and obvious racist sentiment ( anti-white ) be blatant and unsettling - society can be blame people who have choose drug , unemployment and rejection education part film 's " cast " - action people be notact desperation , but rather rejection anything resemble personal ambition and willingness make something out one 's self .
whole Biker movie genre have be make up bad film ever make . one deliver lot fight , generous amount blood , biker fight Indians , and shanty town that get blow up and tear down one shack time . acting be beyond terrible . what ever happen Robert Walker , Jr. ? one point be major studio production , and then just fade away . movie really blow , but have notsee Biker movie long time , be good one watch . end movie , should feel bit trashy have watch !
 Slackers be just teen movie that be notreally worth watching . Dave ( Devon Sawa ) , Sam ( Jason Segel ) and Jeff ( Michael C. Maronna ) be about graduate Holden University Honors lie , cheat and scheme . three roommate have proudly scam their way last four year college and now , final exam , big-men-on-campus be about be bust most unlikely dude school . plot be very stupid and there be reason why watch your look shut brain little while . slacker be just predictable teen flick that really add nothing new genre . comedy Slackers be either hit or miss but there be real true funny or original moment movie . its really just collection gag and be actually pretty funny . though joke that work there be least eight more that do n't . screenplay be full penis and breast joke high school and college student may enjoy . even do probably wo n't remember film awhile its notvery memorable comedy . Jason Schwartzman play freaky Ethan and appear good comedy have stoop pretty low . Jaime King and Devon Sawa be other main star but do rather poor job film . be direct Dewey Nick and be his first film ca n't blame too much . funny character be probably Laura Prepon though , be notmovie very much . film be very short only 86 minute long however , that may be too long people who do n't really type humor . slacker be n't bad film 2002 but certainly be below average . when compare other film genre there be lot well there such notTeen Movie , American Pie and its sequel , Scary Movie 1 & 2 etc. so have see most and be look something new then Slackers might fit bill but its good just watch something else . rating 4.negative below average teen comedy that be worth skip .

One point Ron Palillo 's cameo gay arsonist .
A film so insecure creaters perhaps hope milk original film noir classic title , " Farewell My Lovely " , think gullible would assume remake . character be so foul and unappealing deserve its cold reception when first release . Time only add its absurdity . have none guile , cinematography , desperation or despair classic noir rely instead convoluted and senseless crime plot that would have easily result several arrest hour . as be n't enough throw utterly sexless attempt erotica which least one participant have n't bother bathe several day . only make mess all more painful watch . find good classic forty or fifty film noir instead waste two hour failure .

even do n't realize Sellers be poor health time film and pass away film 's release , FIENDISH PLOT DR . fu Manchu would be painful viewing . be supposedly lampoon Sax Rohmer 's famous Oriental villain but lack focus . potential satirical commentary anti-Oriental overtone Rohmer 's concept be ignore . indeed , movie employ racist insult . there be hardly actual joke or gag , just mostly actor behave idiotically and spout dreary line . be especially distressing see Sid Caesar force spout curse and racial slur attempted laugh . most other actor embarrass well.And then there be Peter Sellers . play dual role sinister Fu Manchu , who be try concoct formula regain his youth and his stalwart British foe Nayland Smith . Sellers be n't one hundred cent bad ; convey quirky warmth Smith when discuss his fetishistic attachment his lawn mower and be oddly move Manchu when express his love English music hall entertainment . but most time , play role weary grimness , thus further sabotage comical possibility . seller ' routine where revitalize his fading strength electric shock be particularly excruciating ; seem too convincingly agonize be funny.A few genuinely witty line , apt slapstick bit Burt Kwouk ( Cato Pink Panther film ) one Manchu 's minion , and Helen Mirren 's amusing musical number can salvage mess . anyone want understand why Peter Sellers be consider comedic genius , wo n't learn anything FIENDISH PLOT DR . fu Manchu .
Connie Hoffman be very pretty and be attractively topless times.That be , folk . sole reason even consider watch film or not.These 70s sexploitation period piece be sometimes entertaining virtue their very datedness ( flare trouser , big hair , Zapata moustache etc. ) . one isn't.The script be bad , acting be bad , direction be bad , and idea have senior citizen romantic lead man be exceptionally bad.The title , hint sex comedy , be grossly misleading.I heartily recommend avoid one plague .

what begin fairly clever farce somewhat shady security monitor company turn , almost instantaneously , uninteresting and completely inane murder mystery . David Arquette and great Stanley Tucci try mightily make train wreck watchable , but thing be just nothumanly possible.What , instance , cause Gale turn suddenly sweet motherly figure drunken shrew Tommy 's parent house ? why would Heinrich , admittedly sleezebag , want destroy business which devote his life , rob and possibly murder his customer ? why do seemingly sensible Tommy believe Heinrich could be murderer ( base almost entirely dream ) , and even be believable , why would n't go police ? and why do n't Gale activate alarm when get home , especially scold Howie be off ? course , all event be necessary plot ( and use term very , very loosely ) unfold . and might be forgivable result even slight bit comedy . but everything , Howie 's description his date rape , coroner 's misidentification Gale , final " joke " Gale and Howie still be dead , be more tasteless and pathetic anything else.I check box indicate my comment contain " spoiler " , but there be nothing more or anyone else could do spoil thing that already stink high heaven .

beginning 90s bring many " quirky " and " off-beat " independent film , particular sub-genre which be semi-spiritual desert crime movie . other note be " Wild Heart " , " Dusk Til Dawn " , and certain extent " Natural Born Killers " . good film spawn junk " Highway @card@ " , " Destiny Turns Radio " and ineptly surreal anti-masterpiece " Hula Moon " . be comedy that aim certain emotional tone , attain , but keep go point irritation . pursuit spirit-world desert and casting Chris Penn be good idea , film be notdirty enough or hard enough be good crime movie , and be n't focus enough laugh really be comedy . wo n't blow ending , but let 's just say be bad . film be basically bad side effect genre-cancer . be dregs indie-mania .
This be notboring movie , audience might stay its chair fascinate selfish character , Miles Berkowitz , film-maker and actor here . storyline be simple : divorce and ten year hollywoodian non-career , author play be quest love front camera . first question be about how true be all : what be write , what come chance ? answer , " yes " or " no " portray M.Berkowitz low average human beeing . look self-fiction love one , recommand read independant comic book : Chester Brown , Joe Matt ... Beside , feel quite disappointed hear so much my country , France . know American people usually say French be arrogant ( that might be true then ) , etc. , and sure French ( and whole world ) have lot grief america , but why so much hate ? do n't think could n't like movie only anyhow .
Tobe Hooper be quite possibly big fluke horror genre have offer . other horror fan , love Texas Chainsaw , but think order put your name front movie title , should have least more one hit movie . ca n't really think other movie Hooper have do ( his own , do n't count Poltergeist ) that have really make impact horror genre or film world . and movie , Night Terrors , just back up my point.Poor Robert Englund , give credit least do good job awful material be give . do what could . as movie ? pure drudge . unnecessary nude scene five minute , story that must have be pen our , and really just awful scenery , music , and cinematography . nothing film be redeemable . do n't waste your time.Overall , 1 10 . feel sorry Hooper , his career seem be over really ever get start . hope be able pump out least one more good flick , way can do his cult status justice .

poorly write script likeable character . as be comedy , forget laugh . be about 2 conceited friend who scam get woman too bed ( sex scene ) and friend(who be semi-discustingly weird)who sometimes also scam but mainly be consider be guy who masterbates . 3 friend separately meet and fall same woman ( Amanda Peet ) . somehow be do really romance . 3 guy stop be friend separately date . scam out their friendship scam woman . -- bad movie
movie have IMDB rating 8.1 expect much more . start out funny and endear energy that feel spontaneous . but movie be half-way through , begin drag and everything become sickingly predictable . character office be delightful first third movie , but get know little too well ; become caricature , notreal people . be same story have see hundred time , only tell here slightly different circumstance . thing be , could stomach predictable love story only dialog be n't so stale ! only thing that could be bad be character have inconsistent and unbelievable motivation , and unfortunately that be also case Dead Letter Office . hopefully movie will end up Dead Movie Office soon .

One minute nice girl turn evil B--ch , then be insecure woman , and so and son on.Normally horror movie ( my book ) can be save gore , once again Valentine do n't have . be as try make PG-13 but fail , so leave edit.Do notsee overly-inspired , rip-off hate , and want die.*1/2 ( 3 ) -J.Leonard Rollins-

be music student , think movie take place conservatory might be fun watch . Little do know ... ( have idea movie be base book Britney Spears ) movie be implausible . be obvious whoever write script never set foot conservatory and do n't know thing classical music . let give just few example : 1 ) there be No Way anyone would be admit classical conservatory classical training whatsoever ! just have nice pop voice be n't enough , besides , that be different thing altogether - genre , different technique . be play violin when apply viola class . 2 ) how come lady teaching music theory be singing jury ? be n't sing professor , would have say situation , and be singing professor , why be n't tell so ? 3 ) be able read music be necessity be major music . 4 ) how do Angela get hold video tape ? would have be keep confidential , jury 's eye only . now either get tape one professor or script writer just do n't have clue . wonder which ... 5 ) singing professor give Holly Carmen song say " have range " , which clearly do not. yes , be able sing note , but Carmen be mezzo-soprano , Holly 's voice seem be much light timbre , notcompatible song . 6 ) Worst : notonly do movie show shocking ignorance when come classical music , but do n't even try hide . aria Angela sing be mutilate recognition , fact which be painfully blatant recital , where be cut short disgraceful way - Mozart would roll over his grave . Habanera Carmen sound bit weird time , too , and way be rearrange end just show how little producer really think classical music - be stiff and boring but hey , add drum and electric guitar and be almost as good Britney Spears ! know be minor detail , but would have be so easy avoid just little research . anyhow , might have choose suspend my disbelief have character and plot be well elaborate . but , really ca n't find redeeming quality movie one : be good laugh .
have idea what idiot give movie Palm D'Or 1999 Cannes Film Festival be atrocious ! actually watch entire thing simply could n't believe someone would make such worthless film . there be nothing interesting plot , character be devoid depth and there be attempt give sort ambiance music or sound effect . also , do decide waste 2 hour your life watch film , be sure bring something throw up cinematography be simply someone run around hand-held camcorder and half time ca n't even see main subject . style have be use much more successfully movie such " Blair Witch " create suspense . Rosetta , there be plot and suspense which style would lend anything . should have know well when come 2 o'clock morning be go be horrible .
movie be so unrelentingly bad , could hardly believe be watch . directing , edit , production , and script all seem as have be do junior high school student who do n't know all much movie . there be narrative flow that make sort sense . big emotional moment and climax ( one early Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts ) and character relationship ( hint very beginning ) come completely out no where and be notset up would have be more elegantly and effectively make film . character be sadly underdeveloped , make difficult have sort connection . acting , surprisingly , be notentirely bad , but terrible writing cancel out relatively convincing performance . film play particularly bad T.V. western/epic , and sadly diminish fascinating ( true ) story attempt tell . have read lot review that defend film be important Australian subject matter . be very well , but just Ned Kelly be important Australian historical icon Does N'T Make THE Movie Good . one be say subject matter be n't good , just quality movie . Pearl Harbor be about very important historical event Americans , but that do n't mean be go defend movie and say be good , be still bad . failure all around , Heath and Orlando be lovely look .

Bad plot , bad dialogue , bad acting , idiotic directing , annoy porn groove soundtrack that run continually overact script , and crappy copy VBS can be redeem consuming liquor . trust , stick turkey out end . be so pathetically bad that have figure be fourth-rate spoof Springtime Hitler.The girl who play Janis Joplin be only faint spark interest , and that be only could sing good original.If want watch something similar but thousand time well , then watch Valley Dolls .
The over-heat plot " Bonjour Tristesse " be take juvenile first novel Francoise Sagan , which become best-seller , God know why . teenager want get rid potential step-parent may have certain appeal . do n't be take fact David Niven play playboy father and Deborah Kerr step-mother-in- prospect . unfortunately , too much rest frail shoulder Jean Seberg . be beautiful and easily fulfill image spoiled teenager . problem be can strike pose but ca n't act . anyone who see Joan arc Otto Preminger 's St. Joan -- Seberg 's first film -- know be incapable 19 carry film . movie , also Preminger , fulfill " promise " first . be her second movie ; be now 20 . what be Preminger thinking ?

will probably get lot flack hate movie- guess do n't approach proper dewy-eyed nostalgia generation . but suffice say- St Elmo 's fire be pretty crap-freaking- tastic , even as far Brat Pack film go.Here be yet lovely example smug , self-indulgent neurosis that be everything 80s ( Rent , anyone ? ) plot be virtually non- existent and philosophy be kitchy good , poorly deliver rest time . complete lack anything resemble sympathetic character do n't help situation . there really be growth , forward movement . even climactic suicide scene be effectually neuter once again refuse let death or anything resemble reality or adult life enter in.Each cookie cutter figure simply go make hate bland , most predictable way possible . Stalker be creep discernible reason other be Stalker and Andie MacDowell be gorgeous . Jackass do everything his power constantly remind be , well , jackass . Gorgeous Slut hide really soulful , deep pain wild lifestyle . Poet mood and mope around full 3/4 film can reveal ( ! ) actually be full teddy bear and sunshine and rainbow . Virgin finally become whole , happy human be get Virgin 's desire one hot roll sack jackass ditch really change ( real time ) . Cheating Bastard cheat be time get catch . and finally Feminist go around douse holy water soul that utter " commitment".Which bring my final beef- what bond super-cement be hold people together friend ? ca n't imagine be just one them- now think vortex create all narcissism center one bar . and be so terrible other- head toilet , rape , and sleep around everrrryone . cherry be two BFFs act total baboon screw feminist , be like , " Umm , actually do n't want be either anymore . let be be friend ! and can hang out totally unawkward way day know may hook up one or other give point , but neither be satisfy enough commitment ( notWord ! ) .

pass one shelf few time , look myriad huge positive quote ( tiny name ) front and wonder be miss something . other night be one movie channel , and tune . miss nothing.I must admit only watch first 30 minute . perhaps movie become comedy gold . give slow , plod pace and complete lack laughter first 30 , seriously doubt it.The lead character start movie classic " do n't know how start my movie " style , long , tiresome monologue how do n't want get sue . be notfunny . be noteven remotely funny . other have comment " San Franclisco " bit ; ok , small chuckle first time say . then grind ground , smile camera be funny thing ever write . get . fact , think talk camera bit be reason instantly dislike film . do n't assume familiarity your audience . familiarity be _earned_ , much respect.From there basically have fat whiny guy talk very effeminate way his dull life temp . do n't realize be Jewish ; be discredit Jewish comedian call " Jewish humor " . be just unfunny humor . just be Jewish do n't mean have knack comedy . Wasp , Spalding Gray , do good job self-analytical humor guy , so obviously be notethnicity.If one bit have see have work , might have stick around . but schlub go about how much love name woman work , then list five long minute , do n't make great movie.This be obvious attempt capitalize popularity " Office Space " . do n't let become victim target marketing . just say no " Haiku Tunnel " .

 Absolute garbage . reason be so terrible be notdeviate formula , but plot be just pathetic.The supposed star do n't do anything solve case - and neither do anyone else really - be just routine police work . utterly tedious.You sit right end hope twist - and get nothing but huge sense disappointment.There be so much potential have relative apparent kidnap . could Lt 's personal involvement finally cloud his judgement ? all obvious sign be stranger do . but surely genius Lt C , constant conversation wrong husband , would gradually uncover fiendish plot involve tape recorder play shower room masked groom surprise bride , hide body and then plant subtle clue . could have be good . be complete waste time .
very beginning , political theme film be so obvious and heavy hand , outcome be entirely predictable . good textbook write screenplay will advise layering character , incorporate character arc , and three act structure . film will find none . police be baddie , and consequently be show shallow , incompetent and coward . never seem occur maker film police might be honourable citizen who see join police good way contribute wellbeing society.The viewer get opportunity make up his or her mind Ned Kelly be good guy or ruthless villain . film open be arrest steal horse , but get clue as his guilt or innocence . see walk door gaol , but only know have be inside three year when hear much later dialogue.This film contain many shot Ned look camera serious expression . find film real chore watch . be direction modern film , and one put off watch more .

Screaming Skull could probably be market sleep aide.- actor do n't help matter much . most deliver line conviction normally reserve grade school play . have n't look up , but would be shock find anyone associate movie ever appear anything cinematic value . wo n't even go script actor be give work . Let 's just say character be give most idiotic line ever utter film.- have be warn ! either avoid one cost or , least , seek out MST3K version .
film be so incredibly bad , almost feel sick watch . up point , other installment have least one good thing . part 1 be suspenseful and gory . part 2 be beat and entertaining . part 3 be interesting great effect . Part 4 have great music , good special effect , and new entertaining Freddy Krueger . part 5 be more boring anything have ever see before . Alice , much pretty blond , Part 4 be back her boyfriend Dan . part , suppose Elm Street installment turn daytime soap . new character seem harsh , and even sweet Alice have chip her shoulder . Freddy seem be completely out one . look tired , and do n't seem be as gruesome . his one-liner seem out place and different , where as Part 4 could be pretty funny . Leslie Bohem 's story never get off ground and Stephen Hopkins ' direction be so bad , make my grandmother look good ! whole plot movie be ridiculous and unrealistic . be also confusing and pretty stupid . avoid Part 5 cost !
movie have plot , character development , and budget . really suck put short term . there be development movie , really ca n't even be look try be artistic or try make statement torture . which leave two other reason possibly watch . be shock or get off like sick little freak . well fall short here too . girl 's reaction just seem dumb . be extremely easy tell be fake ( honestly professional wrestling look more realistic crap try get movie . throw innards , but be asleep most , so be just kinda dumb . only really kind worthwhile part be end when quickly cut scene scene just needle go her eye . but honestly girl be extremely ugly and everything be incredibly fake , exception eye . want good movie torture , go watch Hostel and Hostel 2 . notonly do both contain realistic violence , but there be also actual storyline that draw and make care people . plus tow movie really work deep level consider theme American fear foreigner , issue morality , test how far person can go , human instinct civilization , and many other thing . plus be carefully write and contain good humor when story be n't focus violence . be much good choice piece crap
 Watching stinker constitute cruel and unusal punishment hand Sandler . truly slow and painful death.'Bought DVD $5.88 bin Wal Mart . but thought that keep echo my head be , " how can get my money back ? " most unforgivable thing movie be boat Just Does notSink ! well constructive suggestion : mystery Comedy Theatre . know show SciFi Channel which guy and his muppet-machines spoof most unwatchable horror flick ( Mystery Science Theatre ) . immediately , spin off comedy program and feature flick . good humorous spoof train wreck , fear viewer may actually begin follow Sandler ice pick and chainsaw .
so , American Pie : Beta House be 6th American Pie movie series . , really have nothing do original three American Pie movie character be suppose be relate character original trilogy and Eugene Levy be ( ca n't guy get good gig ? ).There be very little compliment movie on . there be n't funny joke . acting be painful watch , especially girl " southern " accent which sound more Canadian 's impersonation British woman pretend be hillbilly use word " ya will . " movie make feel such idiot . why do n't apply college where nobody go class ( but everybody get good grade ) , girl consistently take their clothes off public , everybody have promiscuous unprotected sex burden baby and STIs , and can ejaculate girl 's family photo her mind ? really , series have lower standard softcore porn . maybe next one , will finally break down and hire Ron Jeremy lead . be sure can just tie series make his character Stifler 's 3rd uncle once remove or something .
Why world would someone make piece trash movie ? first two Zombie Bloodbath movie be stupid enough , but take cake bad trilogy ( perhaps time ) . Todd Sheets be still director , but no longer screenwriter , which be n't negative or positive , consider be just as untalented guy who write one . writing be too heavily reliant f-word , which be use somewhere 200 and 300 time nausea . acting be about par last two Bloodbath movie , so naturally , be bad have ever see . special effect be good last 2 , but still look godawful . plot have become too complicated 's own good , and be about government experiment go wrong and zombie be produce . also feature be cryogenically freeze mutant zombie and school kid that know how time travel , lead one most idiotic ending have ever see . movie go outtake , which be strange whole movie be outtake . only see make fun , go serious mind , might possibly kill yourself.My rating : BOMB/**** . 95 min .
film be so bad , make want vomit . poorly produce , complete laugh free zone . why name god would spoof movie which degree be spoof ( and damn funny one ) stand ? set be laughable , effect so bad be n't even laughable , and act farcical . be complete mystery why would even consider watch lump garbage . National Lampoon once make Animal House , which people still consider be completely and utterly hilarious . now have be relegate make TV movie lump **** . name your expletive , and could be accurately use describe film .
film be terrible . have give high score 2 have see bad , but very few.From clichd start have end film start and go back start end film use everything box trick use film make just sake , kid too many toy . there be endless , boring repetitive narration , slow motion , freeze frame , flashback and merged image etc - none which make dull film better.It be call " 16 year alcohol " , but there be little drinking or drunkeness and depiction withdrawal film jump place coherent sense . story be badly write and extremely pretentious and direction be equally poor and be shame people have put up further money more film Mr Jobson , previously know be rubbish group and TV make much sense film does.I find major struggle see end but hope get well carry bitter but really be waste time and would have be good notbother .
give movie rating 1 ( Awful ) . only reason should even get 1 instead big -0- be Ben Kingsley , who always shine notmatter what terrible material be throw his way.Mira Sorvino be so out her element here viewer simply ca n't get fact be even such piece.Stupid , stupid story and horrible production . do notwaste your video rental $ .
Man , even Plan 9 Outer Space be good movie . flick do n't have enough plot half hour , yet manage extend eternity more hour . Jet Li and Corey Yuen be pretty good , specially exaggerated fight scene , but stuff Legend Fong Sai Yuk be much good sorry thing that would be well left unmake .
Well , what be odd ! exact right moment few redneck amateur-scientists discover cave painting indicate type dinosaur monster might have inhabit area thousand year ago , burn meteor crash lake and spontaneously hatch monster 's egg that have be lie there thousand year , suppose ! " Crater Lake Monster " be movie that literally must be see be believe , but well do so company many friend and pile ganja order make wholesome little bit easy digest . yes , be terrible film utmost ramshackle screenplay imaginable and numerous irrelevant padding interlude that be downright embarrassing , but be also irresistibly charming and so clumsily put together simply have cherish kind fondness . half film least revolve wacky adventure Arnie and Mitch . two local yokel own and run boat rent shop lake , but spend most their day pick their nose and quarrel fascinating stuff spell word " bait " . be mostly their prototypic Laurel & Hardy situation new puddle blood or decapitate head be discover lake . Steve Hanson , heroic but notexactly sharp Sheriff be case , but only be nottoo busy chase big city thug travel area . halfway film , there suddenly be abrupt scene thug rob liquor store and kill two people process . textbook " WTF " moment appear take complete other side country , New York City or something , and have absolutely nothing do event go Crater Lake . only twenty minute later robber pop up again Hicksville and there be " exhilarate " chase wood , end Dino 's hungry muzzle . absurd little detail " Crater Lake Monster " be too numerous mention ! example , be probably only creature-feature which player discover obligatory gigantic footprint AFTER already spot actual monster . goof continuity should be legendary as far be concern . be everybody forget pay attention . night turn twilight day and back twilight all one and same diurnal course ! monster be undeniably good aspect film , especially be accomplish good old fashion and adorable stop- motion effect . cute critter be plesiosaur ; mean aquatic dinosaur look crossbreed Denver last dinosaur and alligator . " Crater Lake Monster " be unique and unforgettable movie- experience can only encourage track down ! miserable 1 10 rating be just out principle ( and basically , be very bad film ) should be put perspective , might as well could have give 10 10 sheer entertainment value .
This seem be good movie , think would be good movie , and movie be hope would be meaningful use my time , and yes , have admit act talent Dimple Kapadia and Deepti Naval where truly commendable , but good effort movie fall short effectively convey meaningful message , which seem be seem be what Somnath Sen be try do . final point come short and ending seem kind unsatisfactory all happen ; bit real life respect but movie real life end about 2hrs and ending should leave audience satisfy , indeed that be director 's intention . fall short respect and be what disappoint most.Another aspect that concern be national stereo-typing American character - all seem be carve out same block . seem most American character Indian English movie be base how common Indian perceive Americans be like and be clear effort have be make bring sense depth or complexity American movie.These two aspect put together make disappointing story .

This be kind movie regret put your VCR . be weird bad rip version Stephen king movie " Misery ( 1990 ) " . can understand how movie get 5.2 score , have story what so ever , and when movie finally end , be relieved.This movie should have be release short-movie instead. . much time be spend same thing . and bad movie , everything happen just end movie 10-15 minute time span ... so , decide watch movie , be sure put new battery your remote control , be go do whole lot fast-forwarding ... do n't worry , wont miss anything important .
explode zeppelin crash down ' Sky Captain ' Jude Law 's base present adequate metaphor describe how truly terrible movie be . first off , let state right bat sincerely doubt Paramount will ever recover money film . cult hit might become , but only be so remarkable what fail achieve . can see studio pitch now . " let be combine 1920 's German expressionism and 1940 be globetrotting adventure modern action flick and use computer animation dominate scene ! wow , wo n't that be success ! " Skycaptain bludgeon viewer its sheer excess . there be too many fake explosion , too many unconvincing dogfight scene , and too few real moment where character be anything but painfully two-dimensional . , why shock and awe one floating airship when can have three , or five , or one hundred ? ! moreover , what could have be groundbreaking film , seamlessly combine computer generate imagery and human actor stylize and intriguing setting , will instead become flop small part fail meet most important requirement flick use CGI . quite simply , graphics be amazingly poor . movement car physics aircraft dogfight , everything seem be just little off . be notbe nit-picky here way . infant could notice car do n't glide road maglev train ( its Mercedes S500 ) . and raise your voice protest , cry out ' be stylize film , be notsuppose be reality ' , let just say . Lord Rings have set standard integrate real-life actor CGI , Starship Troopers have set standard ironic science fiction film , Rocketeer do solid job reintroduce decade 1920 be back Hollywood film portfolio , and Tim Burton 's Batman create unique picture New York City/Gotham that have yet be repeat . Sky Captain fall so short all film , be hard mention same sentence . plus , acting be so poor , make positively ill . so there have . spend $9 see film and get my review . hope might dissuade all make same mistake do .
 Seriously , there be absolutely NOTHING good crap fest . Randolph Scott , closet homosexual who live his lover Cary Grant twelve year , be his most wooden and boring least role . 57 be clearly far too old romantic role , do n't matter so much here Gail Russell look so much old her 31 year and be so ugly due her chronic alcoholism and chain smoking . Lee Marvin play his usual villainous role but be n't enough save garbage . thank God do n't make western more , be just dated , racist old movie that glamorise gun and murder.negative .
 Watching movie make think constantly ; why be make such problem out break brake ? there be million option slow down car ! movie speed writer least thought good reason why car be n't able stop ... there be n't many good thing say film ; all usual narrative cliche be make their appearance , actor be very bad , story be leak sieve etc. make movie waste time and money .
terrible storyline ( Amis his bad ) , pointless and self-conscious ' decadence ' , obvious shock tactic and patchy acting make film ( rather " Rancid Aluminium " ) embody everything that go wrong much-vaunted British film revival . humour be , good , limp , and pretentiousness whole set-up ( include kind " internet terrorist group " - ooh , how contemporary ) really begin grate.Final summary - half-baked attempt be ' edgy ' that do no-one favour . still , be always pleasure see Katy Carmichael screen ...
I join site see what comment people would make absolute disaster film . be n't draw even second . character be all one-dimensional . throw topic could think hope something would stick . would bet ( and hope ) everyone involve Teachers look back embarrassment . there be great actor here but would never know . thank God do n't destroy Morgan Freeman 's or Judd Hirsh 's or Nick Nolte 's or Laura Dern 's career . there be vision , labor love here , only horrible effort go wrong . BTW do n't think writer ever set foot real school .
whatever happen British TV drama ? John Major Tony Blair , focus genre appear have shift social realism smugly normative women-focused tale piddling domestic problem nice middle class professionals.(Or perhaps TVNZ do n't buy good stuff ? please let be what be ... )The writer 's long career soap probably explain why dialogue be make up mostly stale clichs . Niamh Cusack 's performance be strong meaningful look , hold director least half dozen beat longer deserve . baleful look , however , be poor substitute depth character , writer have fail provide such material actor work with.Of course be theoretically thriller , murder investigation ; but be notas important central character 's fail marriage and its attendant problem . be Cusack 's character be husband complete bastard ? will son be utterly traumatize marriage break up ? make central issue be n't sign insight -- indicate profoundly narcissistic identification writer and director character who should be get her job.Lynda La Plante know how write stuff so feel as matter and involve viewer other housebound neurotic ; evidently Paula Milne be n't up task .
Too many secondary plot line primary one . too many hot button be push reason , manage stuff boring film , that do notsay anything , drama element that be out there : death , divorce , money issue , parent problem , suicide , psychological problem , drug abuse , adoption , reject love , travel problem , sex , generation misunderstanding , robbery , legal issue , gun , medical ethic , " deep real love " would think would make interesting movie , but hell all event be secondary something primary which be notthere . boring . notmention " super-deep " ( and super-long ) lecture child end film be total nonsense . Pity.Oh , forget mention : actor , all , be quite good . be what keep turn off . bad their talent go waste , film be well shoot , too : light , motion etc. episode -- that be all place . be just meaning that be miss .
decrepit rank already over-saturated ' Hillybilly Horror ' sub-genre come woeful tale vacation family terrorize inbred redneck . sound familiar ? well most definitely should anyone even cursory knowledge horror genre . there be absolutely new here . film seem content recycle all old worn out clichs ( deform hick , peaceful family turn gun-toting killer when push come show , rebellious daughter , one ' freak ' who be good heart , etcetera ... ) , but do even half-heartedly enough make utter waste time . be forgettable dreck , but humorously enough lead J.D. Hart once star movie call " film Suck " earlier his career , quite ironic omen indeed.My Grade : d-
screen writing be so dumb pain have waste 2 hour my life will never get back ( where have hear before ) . acting be so-so . thing change often enough keep watch and wait something gruesome happen . nevertheless there be n't single original thing movie . first cube be nerdy horror movie , which do n't make whole lot sense end , cube zero have pick up and try retell exactly same story , time make obnoxious point try spoon-feed explanation detail first movie do n't answer . comic thing be , director recycle exact scene first movie that be somewhat weird , and try explain . but scene be just copy over , there be coherence whatsoever . script be sooo pointless . can imagine be write half-wit 15 year old baseball cap and pack beer class project . good part be end , cripple ' good ' wunderkind guy , and become retarded fellow first movie , and see when find ( ' room be green. . ' ) Cube 1997 . Goodie gooodie , clap clap , what twist . first , what about have n't see first one , do n't make sense nitwit director . oh , great idea : instead number identify x,y,z coordinate room ( cube 1997 ) , time be 3 letter , one give one 26 possible coordinate value . Duh . now permutation do n't make much sense anymore..so let letter disappear anybody can use them..I want my money back.I guess have write down there be just so many bad , inconsistent , or just stupid idea movie . Directors/writers should be require possess talent .
sorry everyone , , , know be suppose be " art " film , , but wow , should have hand out gun screening people could blow their brain out and notwatch . scene design and photographic direction be excellent , story be too painful watch . absence sound track be brutal . loooonnnnng shot be too long . how long can watch two people just sit there and talk ? especially when dialogue be two people complain . really have hard time just get film . performance be excellent , but how much dark , sombre , uninspired , stuff can take ? only thing i like be Maureen Stapleton and her red dress and dancing scene . otherwise be ripoff Bergman . and i be fan f his either . think anyone who say enjoy 1 1/2 hour be , , well , lie .
be quite simple . Friends be comedy very basic humour aim teenager and young adult , unsophisticated sense humour.It be also painfully obvious end , be desperately try make last 10 season , most likely could say beat Seinfeld 's 9 season run . trouble be , Seinfeld have 9 amazing season great writing , Friends have ( and be be very generous here ) most 5 or 6 OK season and then 4 abysmal seasons.It become soap opera recycled humour and recycled character trait that be n't good so start , then get bad 100th time see . find so hard understand why people rate so highly . be truly awful .
case be good part movie but alone be notworth purchase price . expect " base true story " movie only find shot home video hodge-podge poorly shoot clip tie together pathetic acting and non-related slaughter house scene . video scene have numerous rewind situation which be use probably extend length feature rather effect . start review be even halfway movie and wait be over just case have good ending but , low and behold only get bad . could mark low would have be negative ten . learn my mistake and save your money and time one .
movie be really bad . acting be plain awful Michael Ironside . do n't get story . Richard Grieco be only survivor fight two Mc-gangs . come town and suddenly be choosened fight bad people who want indian-land . cover say be Indian that return too his home-town , do n't hear movie , so be n't clear.Richard Grieco be one hell bad actor . stiff and ugly . say his line too . and would n't talk Sean Young , hasn ' be my favourite actor but movie play Indian woman who fall love Bolt ( Grieco ) . be awful.When rent choosed and Subterfuge Amanda Pays . choosed one Michael Ironside be cast . maybe should have take Subterfuge.Do n't see think Richard Grieco look tough motorbike sunglasses.I will soon uptade cast-list have home . write down see movie .
probably somebody hear Alberto Tomba . former policeman , former sky champion , and , now , terrible actor . " Alex L'Ariete " be plan be TV " mini serial " , but Italian television refuse show movie its channel . now be , believe , ridiculous movie . script be simply hilarious ( be suppose be dramatic movie ) , something 5 year old kid work . but what really blow away be amateurish acting : Alberto Tomba , who actually be notbelievable policeman , play terribly totally silly character : special operation Italian policeman specialize smash door open ! ( " ariete " be " ram " ) . super-guy will try save young nice girl life ( actual Italian " little " TV showgirl , marry singer Eros Ramazzotti ) : nice but absolutely inept acting . lose one and make favour . movie that be shame Italian cinema industry : only John Travolta Earth Attack get close. .
movie be bizarre . good put , be " freakin ' weird " . could give plot summary , or hoity toity analysis , but would consider waste your time . anybody need know movie be two young sister , one incestuous relationship , homicide , post mortem mutilation , and one really disturbing infatuation . end movie feel need go take shower wash filth , but notgood way " Pulp Fiction " or " Fight Club " . be be teenager ( or high schooler be i be still teenager)and have just do something A : wish have n't do , and B : hope Good Lord Heaven and Earth your parent never find out about . and nobody like . my advise be rather defile your mind and watch piece wanton cinematic filth , just go waste your time something little less horrible and watch " Kazaam"(yes , would rather watch " Kazaam " " Murderous Maids " , read what want ) .
Given lot horror film be base premise one or more central character do something stupid stage proceeding , girl film would be collect Gold , Silver and Bronze Darwin Awards Olympic ceremony . mentally disabled baboon would have make good choice do , and would have scream lot less do so.If like film grainy picture , deliberately amateur camera-work ( my 92 year-old grandmother wield camcorder good result ) , extremely poor sound and discernible plot/narrative , then be your ideal film . also note should enjoy following : woman scream reason , woman whine reason . fact reason and logic do n't appear much film . example : " have find Stephanie " " yeah ca n't believe be speak , like , last night " " call last night ? " " yeah , want talk date get ask " " what ? how come do n't tell " ? , our friend be be chase serial killer shotgun and array grisly weapon but have problem fact do n't tell be go date.Okay , so budget be low . do n't mean have make look cost half budget . ' score ' be interesting - exception one - track have be write and perform writers/directors film . fact would appear entire budget have be blow sample track Duskfall , death metal band Sweden.The most worrying thing entire film be ending which leave possibility sequel .
recent time have be subject both movie and " King Arthur " , DVDs choose other evening 's " entertainment " and together achieve nothing more bear out grow notion have modern movie-watching public totally lack discrimination , and be content as long get " action " . movie be utter rubbish.Whatever happen character development ? whatever happen meaningful dialogue ? whatever happen Acting ? and , when watch something that vaguely purport be " historical " , whatever happen attempt capture measure accuracy , realistic idea " political map " time , even slight flavour era , especially its social attitude . why do all have display value set 21st century America ? have read message board disclaimer " little be know " dark age . not. considerable amount be know , much learn scholarship era , but joker simply could n't be bother do homework.I only wish could vote negative
rent movie sound pretty interesting but my horror movie be bad movie have ever see ! read comment Gumby-8 and have be part cast or crew . Gumby-8 be 4 year old child or demented cult member no one their right mind would think movie have potential all.I could n't believe Gumby-8 's comments.Quoting : " " Dune " inspire open animation quick pace ... film keep eye move and work so well repeat viewing be notunexpected."The Animation be only aspect movie that be interesting and fact that film keep eye move , well be keep look type suspense . mean give break Halloween be shoot budget $100,000.00 and painted mask and also way become cult classic . as far " repeat viewing be notunexpected " think make typo.Another quote Gumby-8 only Fan : " acting be also strong aspect film."With due respect actor , their performance be nothing more respective talent Robert Napton.The catchy Tagline : " beware hour dusk and darkness"That be there be dusk or darkness movie.MPAA rating " rate R violence/gore"The only gore see be red paint sheet dead body never see . as far know might be clump grass.In summation , have see horror flick 50 be , @card@ 's and @card@ 's . have see what think be absolutely bad and that be very good . director film either do notmake attempt , be asleep , or take hit acid . whatever case think actor deserve applause try salvage very poor job direction . would give film rating .5 ' B ' movie .
Strange how less 2 hour can seem lifetime when sit such flat , uninspire drivel . story be as personal supposedly be Sally Potter , would n't expect little passion show through her performance ? her acting be completely detach and feel chemistry Sally and Pablo and tango scene , which should have be fiery give nature dance , be instead awkward and painful watch . obviously , reveal such personal story film can be daunting , and such Sally Potter would have be wise let good actor take task rather let her passion fall victim her own sheepishness .
film ca n't make up its mind its message be " human be evil and bad and animal be sweet and blameless " or " do n't ever go water again . " fisherman ( Nolan ) be out nab killer whale , very bad thing , but when accidentally ( accidentally mark ) hit pregnant cow instead her mate , cow -- and use word sense -- who be obviously sick psycho-bitch and canonical villain piece -- throw propeller try chew bit most distressing and hideous notmention ineffectual method kill . ( doubt be her first . ) when her unborn fetus abort her hideous self-inflicted wound , her mate go mental revenge and swear hurt , kill and mutilate human who even so much talk Nolan . obviously as human , total psycho date other total psychos.The film reek half-thought anti-human message , " poor poor whale ! ! evil man must suffer and die ! " and yet , do notsucceed demonize Nolan . be true when set out his motive be selfish and cruel , but first squeal first whale grow heart and , film progress , grow more and more compassionate whale 's pain seem will walk out ice and give whale , just make feel little better.The film final journey , which Nolan follow whale bizarre journey north , remind Melville 's eerie man-whale connection , and moment hint truly interesting conclusion , where two husband might connect , understand even respect other their own grief , Nolan lose his wife and unborn child also accident . be clear Nolan respect whale and feel its loss . however , never go there . whale-character have compassion or respect anyone.The final scene lose focus and become Jaws-like where sea-monster finally kill everybody and Nolan and no-doubt oversight , fail chomp up whale-hugger ( Tho make good snap her head little earlier . ) love animal , and detest whaling , and what be more love orca whale , but film 's goal be make feel whale be victim and people be evil and detestable completely fail . Nolan show compassion and growth , and feel other , and all whale think about be kill and maiming.The only message can walk away be " see orca whale , ever , anywhere , run other way cause step his fin wrong way , will hunt end earth destroy everything . "
previous reviewer say movie be notall bad . what ? ! ? ! ? ! movie glorify child molestation . oh , but Sylvia Kristel be naked , so let be give 5 10 star . why notfull 10 ? filmography be " agonize , " child 's look shock be " unrealistic , " and fat friend be " irritate . " nowhere review do reviewer express outrage American movie 1981 featured scene child have sex grow woman . happen catch steam loaf movie stay hotel that have Showtime . , even fat friend have act up storm and be deserving Oscar , would still have give movie only 1 star . TV 's Howard Hessman star movie same time be appear WKRP be particularly ridiculous . but do n't take my word !
 Houseboat Horror be great title film . be absolutely spot-on , and therefore only aspect film which can give 10 out 10 . there be houseboat , there be horror , there be even horror that take place houseboat . but there be ever tagline film poster , would surely be ' something shonky way come ... ' Houseboat Horror be easily bad Australian horror film have ever see , notmention one bad horror film have ever see , and fairly atrocious attempt film-making general . good news be , be so bloody awful , sail straight zone viewer contempt wonderful world unintentional hilarity . be worth watch *because* be bloody awful.The category ' bad ' come notstoryline , simple reason there actually be one : record producer , film crew and rock band drive up mystifyingly-named Lake Infinity , picturesque rural retreat somewhere Victoria ( reality Lake Eildon ) shoot music video . someone be n't especially happy see there and , possibly attempt do audience favour , start pick one one very sharp knife . even more mystify be how long take survivor actually notice this,On surface , look very bog-standard B-movie slasher . have get highly-annoying youth , intolerant elder , creepy local ( one whom , petrol station attendant , would easily win gurning competition ) , and let be face , my description murderer could easily be Jason Voorhees . ah , but only acting and production value be anywhere near good comparative masterpiece that be Friday 13th Part VII . unfortunately , Houseboat Horror be completely devoid both things.But end , only make what do get so ridiculous and amusing . fan one-time ' Late Show ' and ' get This ' member Tony Martin will already be aware real dialogue gem ( ' check out view ... will bar up ! ' ) , actual song accompany music video be so bad have be hear be believe - ca n't help wonder writer/director Ollie Wood hope would actually become hit . horror element be comparable think B-slashers genre and particularly period , but there be time when could n't help imagine someone bite hamburger off-screen and see volley tomato sauce spray wall on-screen.Indeed , have be listen Tony Martin recommend film hilarious rubbish , do n't think will be disappoint . fan ' so-bad-it's-good ' horror should notpass up opportunity . will ' bar up ' or notthough be matter . , other hand , be search genuine excellence Australian horror genre , get copy incomparable ' Long Weekend ' and do n't look back .
think read somewhere be last Monogram production , but that be true or notdo n't matter , be n't , then should have be . be deadly dull affair star John Carradine gray his hair make appear old scientist who be experiment aid his young apprentice ( Robert Shayne ) bring dead back life . time their subject be revive , seem have whitish face marble be lie strap laboratory table ( big deal ) . Carradine manage restore his faithful dog life be dead , and mutt gain unusual ability walk wall ghostlike fashion ( wooooooooohhhh ) . be about all wrote.For ultra-cheap Monogram quickie , thing least actually utilize more fancy-schmancy lab setup be usually allot . funny run joke movie be " old " doctor Carradine constantly refer his " young " assistant Shayne " m'boy " when , fact , Carradine be actually 40 and Shayne be 45 when make !
This be great story and be just beginning equality United States . ( be still work too . ) however fact be true , be still movie and be movie site . realize independent film have hard time get good actor , but wow . only one even mediocre be excellent Ossie Davis . but even could n't make up all actor ( include one play young man ) absolutely atrocious acting . grant script be terribly clich , but even then have get get decent actor ! would n't recommend anybody be so poorly do category . read book true story U.S.S Mason , give man respect deserve .
film be bad . there be other way say . story be weak and outdated , especially country . do n't think most people know what " walker " be or will really care . feel as be watch movie 70 's . subject be just notbelievable year 2007 , even be set DC . think ring true everyone else who watch too applause be low and quick end . most do n't stay Q&A ; either.I do n't think Schrader really think film out ahead time . many scene seem be cut short as be never finish or just do n't know how finish . jump one scene next and have try and figure out or guess what be go . really do n't get Woody 's ( Carter ) private life or boyfriend either . what be all " artistic " male bondage and torture picture ( Iraq prison ) about ? what be thinking ? think be his very poor attempt try create dark private subculture life Woody 's character ( Car ) . do n't work . do n't even seem make sense really.The only good thing film be Woody Harrelson . play his character ( Car ) flawlessly . really do get great sense what " walker " may have be ( say twenty year ago ) . be great and most likely will never get recognize it.As Lauren , Lily and Kristin ... Boring.Do n't see ! be painful ! be true Harrelson fan .
be question have ask when watch movie " what be point ? " movie be nothing but hour and half confusion completely unlikable people ( notgo use word actor ) and script could tell do n't exist.One thing that make laugh most movie be how say " Victorian story write " which mean there be actually script part story . entire Victorian section have dialogue , and be just comprise shot guy stare girl and vice versa . make part movie script camera leave train station.OK , time story . start out guy sit chair never once get out . oh block , who need ? newspeople come his house and practically beg tell story dead girl . so start off story Victorian time . and here be how scene go ( Guy and girl be field . pretty music start play ) ( guy stare girl ) ( girl stare guy ) ( guy stare girl ) cut back movie . be pretty much that happen about half movie.The rest film be incredibly awkward dialogue bunch model want buy apartment . real estate agent show one and when i say dialogue be awkward i mean , be dancer would trip MACARENA . none character movie be likable . model be incredibly irritate , Victorian people do n't talk , and guy tell story have personality sack onion . so eventually all girl get kill off . and kill off , i mean drug offscreen . ooh . show ONE death ? and death i mean hold her face put blood makeup ? awesome.HOW guy even know story baffle . say be see . but how ? there be guy apartment ! door be lock shut way out , window be attach fire escape that be too rotten work , how hell do see all ? oh plot hole . DO love . movie finish up newswoman say " i think make up . be waste our time " fact beg interview first place . whatever . movie be stupid , pointless , and make sense lot plot hole . could go and movie , but i do n't see need . i will much rather spend my time do something uselful . widdle something . " hell 's threshold " more belong purgatory 2 dumb model . out 10 .
This be one bad movie have ever see . Branaugh seem have so much trouble remember his accent could n't deliver his line . plot be definitely notworthy John Grisham 's name . wonder be never publish book or release theater . do n't even watch whole thing . decide do n't care who do , then realize there be " whodunit " care about !

One bad film ever . notfunny , poor TV style cinematography , bad acting . sad see so many famous old actor barely able walk , let alone act . Lead female Nancy Young ca n't act . terrible direction . sub-par bad TV movie . occasional weak joke fall flat . even basic premise movie make sense . somehow be suppose stop wedding happen but there be logic their action . slow pace make my wife stop watch but suffer . old man be suppose be act be young and horny , but come off as pathetic instead funny . how do even get money make ?
have check IMDb BEFORE rent DVD Netflix , will have couple hour my life back . be frankly suspicious when see film 's director also write . case , accord credit , same guy be " writter and director " - unfortunately , indication overall quality production . there be few interesting moment ( e.g. , Judy Tenuta 's scene remind her early comedy routine tout Judy-ism ) which lead rate two star rather one . moment , however , be few and far ... and almost do notget see opening sequence be nearly incomprehensible , notmention reprehensible its violence . admit go back watch part again see have miss something that would help figure out have see whole thing . Nope , least recognize who character be who would turn out be important later . " spinning camera " technique be overuse and essentially pointless . find talk TV screen : " what ? ! ? " or " goodness sake , get on ! " notrecommend .
Nothing happens.Then character personality do n't develop.Then end never come there be beginning and middle.There be beautiful shot that be make notbeautiful be n't even allow be , movie be n't even THERE . there be no " be " movie there be plot or character or theme or idea or symbolism or discussion or dialog or point . there be nothing ! there be good point : have good soundtrack . but sound edit be such and movie proper be such watch be n't even worth your time , so be really interested , will suggest go and buy soundtrack or something . will get everything can movie all fatigue , headache , and impatience.--PolarisDiB
Tim Robbins and John Cusack be two actor have appreciate their career , and be only reason choose watch movie . well , all can say be totally regret ! two great actor humiliate all way perform number irrelevant , unimaginative and kitch extreme ( notbe bad its own)sketches that be suppose make people laugh , but fail do so . only reason can think be director be their friend , and decide support his movie star it-I ca n't think anything else movie be so cheap ! fortunately Tim Robbins and John Cusack have n't disappoint ever since . would recommend avoid film , want your opinion two actor spoiled .
 Repetitive music , annoy narration , terrible cinematography effect . half plot seem center shock value and other half seem be focus appease type crowd that would nag people start fight.One good scene be " delete scene " section , one where be principle 's office her mom . do n't understand why will cut . movie seem desperate make point anything could and Domino talk sorority would have be highlight movie.Ridiculous camera work be reminiscent MTV , and completely notneed or helpful movie . speed film up just jump lot thing and rotate camera something repeatedly get old first time be use . be director be want use up all extra footage do n't want throw away.Another movie Jerry Springer ? should have tell notwatch preview.A popular movie " " crowd .
ever hear Taiwanese horror movie ? or Taiwanese movie ? Propably reason . one be really boring one , even have black magic include wither baby body and people explode inside thousand eels.Having read other people thought , be look forward violence and gore , but there be notmuch . blood puke and other lame stuff , be wait graphic gore or gruesome effect will be disappoint . clearly do n't use eel explode and other thing their maximum potent.Pretty much nothing good movie ; single character that be n't completely bland and few OK black magic spell , eel one . plot be confusing and boring . character be thin and annoy , include main character . horror aspect do n't work , most horrify thing be albino girl ( notscary really ) . be bad Asian horror movie have ever see .
have see my share Woody Allen 's movie , and be notalways great , can usually be sure be go be entertain . probably last really good one be Bullets Broadway ( ' 94 ) and Mighty Aphrodite ( ' 95 ) - then one have see have be patchy but watchable . and so when be invite see new Woody Allen movie Melinda and Melinda , which be n't even aware have be release yet , go along happily . have n't really hear much hope would be pleasantly surprised.What get be definitely bad Woody Allen movie have see . premise be over-explained , cast be terrible , script be slow and lifeless . too many scene say nothing and yet be stretch out , assume fill out what would have otherwise become 15 minute short film.I do n't mind concept film - two director discuss how simple situation could be interpret comedy or tragedy , and obviously film proceed show , play out scenario . problem be neither ' two film ' be any good . comedy be n't funny and tragedy be n't very tragic . seem Allen come up good idea but then run out steam , or time , actually complete film.The general level acting be notably bad also - Will Ferrell be only one who bring anything table , and be basically Woody Allen impression . previously good actor Chloe Sevigny just come off annoy , and bad bunch be Radha Mitchell Melinda ( which be shame , her character be nearly scene ! ).To be fair actor , script be work be lack notnon-existent . definitely long way Allen know and love classic Manhattan or Annie Hall .

The Haunting be yet bad horror remake phony overdo special effect and big cast screen favorite and have redeeming quality whatsoever maybe cinematography.Yes remake be n't bad but remake direct Jion Da Bont definitely are.I suppose A-List actor ( Liam Neeson,Catherine Zeta Jones,Owen Wilson)are there distract boring plot,ridiculous special effect , and terrible attempt scare 's audience however be movie nottabloid magazine do n't care whose care character and story two thing film missed.The storyline be take classic novel Haunting Hill House and rip out four chapter and then use whatever be leave film be so boring and lot be unexplained.The character be pretty thin and acting be good do n't really care character all.Lily Taylor give horrendous performance and sound be 8 year old when deliver her line notmention what horrible screamer is.Lily Taylor be n't make horror genre all.The ghost be stupid and cheesy , look bunch Casper The Friendly Ghost 's and ghost Hugh Cain look fat guy dress grim reaper Halloween smoke machine.There be creature roof one room that be giant purple mouth and be noteven funny unintentionally just plain sad.The house be pretty and well design that be probably only positive thing movie look nice but that do n't save 's brutal everything else.I can honestly say i feel i be waste my time watch haunting TV price would have be even more pi$$ed have pay see but luckily be Scream Channel.Overall The Haunting be boring remake that try overwhelm bad special effect , poor attempt horror .

One Star . be all documentary deserve . have n't feel disappointed watch movie , let alone documentary , quite time.I be Big fan " Walking ... " series , include 's Nigel Marvin spin-off , all their gleeful fun yet informative information . and subject prehistoric man have never interest nearly as much other prehistoric creature , subject be still interesting and unique explore . have see all other doc series , figure need see one well , especially see relatively good review other places.Well who put up good review doc ... what be thinking ? ! lol.Though information be able get be interesting , presentation fail other way possible . have terrible flow , be incredibly unfocused what be try say ( information scramble and sometimes out place ) , horrible effect ( that include few moment CGI and especially makeup effect ) , and overused MTV-style camera effects.Speaking makeup effect , one reviewer here mention how laughable scene be when caveman come giant ape and how look lot 70s man-in-suit horror movie . well there be plenty moment just like be people portray ape man look ridiculous and act ridiculous . none be help horrible camera position and compositions.The bad part be none be show interesting or dynamic way , or look remotely real . do n't even look be take seriously . also lack emotional punch predecessor series have . remember episode " Walking Dinosaurs " fate Ornithochirus ( sp ? ) ? episode still get verge tear time watch . be sort engagement subject that lack here most . when be more engage subject and be own personal story , even one that be just speculation , care more fact surround it.The only save grace production be fairly good narration ( least BBC version see ) and music . otherwise , do notbother even rent one want have good laugh ( which do frequently , but usually follow rolling eye ) . do notbelong shelf other " Walking ... " docs.And do make sense learn doc be notproduce or directly involve same people who do other series ? hmmm ...
 Invasion Star Creatures would definitely be " so bad be good " category film be n't quite so sexist or racist . be such just make plain bad.It have same kind hardline stereotypical sexism see Queen Outer Space , and kind racist stereotype ( instance , Native Americans ) would normally find thirty & forty b-westerns . term be non-funny , same walking-through-the-cave gag be repeat well ten time course fairly short movie . Ray do do one good impression Jimmy Cagney ( but ca n't make work two impression Cagney row , nor handle Peter Lorre when try ) . there really be n't production value speak , " Star Creatures " make Ro-Man Robot Monster or Tor Johnson Plan 9 Outer Space look creation Industrial Light and Magic.This film be definitely one vanguard what would have call early independent cinema ... notartsy enough theater and notgood enough anything but last feature all-night drive-in .
Dieter Bohlen , Germany 's notorious composer and producer slightly trashy pop hit " be my heart , be my soul " feel need tell his story - and gracefully decide hire ghost writer . result be funny book his life . well , more or less fuzzy image . do n't deny be selfish asshole but whole story be twist fit his image . word have probably beat up his former wife and end up hospital . however be write funny style and huge success his appearance jury member German version " American Idol " - especially his unforgettable comments.This should be end story - really . hype mention " Idol " TV show call " Deutschland sucht den Superstar " ( abbreviate DSDS ) somebody must have come up terrible idea make movie out book . result be " Dieter - der Film"I have rarely see movie which try so desperately be funny and fail so completely . none gag really hit point . Naddel 's voice and style talk be get my nerve right away Verona 's voice should have do more . obvious , childish , predictable and lengthy gag destroy motivation watch movie end few minute . content movie be sloppy film adaption write sloppily down ghost writer base Bohlen 's sloppy idealize memory . could have use freedom do almost everything . be suppose be satire , but fail . story be totally uninterest and fact background voice be Bohlen guarantee whole film have nothing satirical all.It be wonder be consider bad cinema release . probability thing would have rotten archive be quite high recently when current season DSDS turn out be mediocre success . " friendly " help Germany 's big yellow press newspaper " Bild " and desperate situation TV station RTL have something program still unbeatable show " Wetten dass ... ? " be run Channel 2 movie finally arrive television - unfortunately.Watching movie be waste time - there be certainly good cartoon much more fun and story actually worth look at.Therefore : negative
means be movie bad ' Perfect Stranger ' , but just be n't funny . could n't stick one type comedy - jump SNL , Adam Sandler-esquire , romantic , little guy score big , slapstick , ' Loser ' ( movie ) type comedy . there be pretty funny slapstick moment ( fall hill ) , one be very particularly funny or outstanding way . ' Schindler 's List ' be funny ( and feel short ) . never know Andy Samberg be suppose be high school , college dropout , or just loser living home his mother - Sissy Spacek , her bad choice role . and poor Ian McShane , serious actor only have name one , be give crap read camera . story drag and be completely predictable up and include end ( spoiler here case Adam Samberg 's mom want see ) . do n't spend ANY money go see movie , and maybe Lorne Michaels will get hint and start produce quality ( Yes , Wayne 's World and Tommy Boy be quality ) movie .

" Iowa " want be " Requiem dream " Midwest meth , but come across hard R rate " Reefer Madness".Yes , drug be bad , and meth be horribly pernicious , addiction and how destroy people , family and community . but character who be either dumb or ridiculous and eye-rolling plot wo n't teach lesson anyone.While writer/director/star Matt Farnsworth have charisma screen , his partner Diane Foster play wincibly silly wide-eyed innocent corrupt drugsas be already satirize Susan Sarandon " Rocky Horror Picture Show " . really feel sorry all totally unnecessary nudity be put through . be n't end film realize be suppose think two be recent high-school graduate explain their naivet , be bombard their school photo , but so , even look old folk " O.C. " . have good chemistry screen , be pale imitation " Badlands"-type couple.The guest star be badly use . Michael T. Weiss , who be so good TV 's " Pretender " , be completely ludicrous corrupt parole officer and his brutal violence be just plain crazy , his character pretty much ruin social significance film . Rosanna Arquette have be even sleazy roll around David Cronenberg very low rent Livia Soprano . John Savage even have mouth old baby boomer excuse do pot but be bad . Goth chick show up , odd explanation be stripper Des Moines . obligatory Latino drug dealer appear - Iowa ? limited budget , interior view meth use be portray quite vividly , quite scary hallucination . certainly see go crazy.While Iowa location be use very well ( include amusing scene propane gas robbery ) , accent and church reference be confusingly Southern Baptist . gun seem be use law abide and law breaking citizen here more inner-city drug-dealing movie.The song Iowa 's good know bard Greg Brown be use , but oddly be notlist credit . hope be use permission.I catch its commercial run NYC miss Tribeca Film Festival where get considerable -- and inexplicable -- buzz .
when teenager go trip camp van there be many clichs can guarantee will follow.1)The teenager will be warn notgo where be go crazy local . Dan Van Husen handle ridiculous exposition deadly Sirens . what , who , how and why be handle one almost unintelligible burst . 2)The van will break down . 3)Whilst look help group will be split up and be pick one one whatever monster have be warn about.4)They will find house inhabit madman , will capture . 5 ) house will have phone but will notwork , will be disturbingly decorate , there will be flicker neon light , spider and maggot . 6)The madman will catch try escape vehicle that wo n't start ( here high speed getaway be be make tractor ) . 7)The madman will be seemingly kill only come back dead cheap , weak scare and will then be kill properly . 8)Only girl will be leave alive group . 9)There will be unnecessary twist end.Add element naked Sirens ( who character seem react startling different way fact everyone that see be suppose fall lust immediately ) that seduce and kill teen , throat be rip out and body be pull half and have something resemble twelve year old boy dream movie.I think be only fair say my opinion director and his previous work be as low be possible be but be happy point out there be few element boarder pleasurable and be great improvement his previous film , Darkhunters , which be one bad film have ever see . time cinematography be very good , music and edit be cut his previous film and other low budget horror movie . be impress hear be achieve third money spend previous monstrosity . however , bad thing movie be notbe find body film , be ultimately mildly divert pointless movie that have be do time and time again , but DVD extras.If do rent film implore listen director 's commentary be belief . there be more say film . One staggering part commentary be director 's claim film be clich leaden be preconceive idea . say be deliberate attempt use clichs and openly wonder " people will get it".I be afraid say be suppose be clever nod and wink film past and genre clichs then be notwittily script enough , act appropriate tone nor direct enough style work . film be make order lead ask one question ; " what be point ? " be S afilm that just slip right canon bad horror movie , attempt do something clever or different have n't worked.The next nugget brilliance be conversation snobbery digital film format . rightly point out digital be often synonymous cheapness and ease use . however , good moment conversation come when bemoan fact when Michael Mann make film format be brand visionary . there be simple distinction be make here ; Mann be talented director who will use format fit his story and style , Roberts be horror hack who use produce bottom shelf genre picture . think difference be obvious and comparison be notonly arrogant but redundant.The good moment be reserve Robert 's comment people who have take time review his previous film . who do n't be generalise ' geek ' and even go as far as single out specific people have nerve voice their opinion forum that encourage do just that . must admit be slightly disappoint my review his last film be n't single out ridicule . tirade go further group joke Norwegian reviewer , complete ' hilarious ' accent imply people Norway would n't know good film simply because where be bear . always sort comment say more say be target , simply make director and his friend look ignorant.The package round out tasteful featurette how Sirens be cast . Robert 's swear blind voice over , ' do n't want make film that be Baywatch ' see audition tape topless and naked girl writhe around ground . there be also simper , self-indulgent documentary making Darkhunters which Robert 's say reviewer have claim Forest be " well British film year " . do n't know who be try convince . one point commentary track Robert 's say jokingly " can see people sit home say " be n't amazing , its sh$t " be n't wrong .
" Wrinkle Time " book series be my favorite series childhood . have read and re-read more time can count last 35+ year . character , all their virtue and flaw , be near and dear my heart . adaptation contain very little wonderful , magical , spiritual story love so much . say be disappoint film would be great understatement.If have never read book(s) imagine will enjoy movie . acting be passable , special effect be well do make TV movie , and story be interesting . however , love book , avoid movie costs.I find statement Wikipedia page novel : " interview Newsweek , L'Engle say film , ' expect be bad , and is.'"I , reviewer here , feel need read book again dispel movie my mind .
do n't let name film deceive , reality Jake speed character be quite possibly lazy action hero ever know film . when Jake Speed be notsave virgin girl evil madman , which be often not, be seriously relax . perhaps add his charm , but my opinion action hero be notsuppose " chill out " whenever get chance . furthermore , other daring hero who usually have impressive list talent , man have none , course call sleep talent . anyhow , movie be basically worthless , writing be sub par and action , when there be , be very lame . ( machine gun jeep be n't bad , but be ) so , be mood watch movie that be cure insomnia , then piece be perfect - have hero notonly put sleep , but also his audience .
piece crap , ca n't call movie , can be sum up following.-Stereotypical black criminal black midget partner get trouble -Black Midget pretend be baby fully develop adult face , body hair and genitalia -Black midget be mistaken(somehow) man and woman who happen want baby -Black midget go on commit act physical and sexual violence , demean white people wherever see , and commit more crime -Happy EndingHonestly , could have be good satire have n't be direct so shallowly and have such talentless bastard star .
Kill Me Later " have interesting initial premise : suicidal woman ( Selma Blair ) verge jump off top office building be protect bank robber ( Max Beesley ) who promise " kill her later."The actual execution premise , however , fall flat almost action serve mere device move plot its predictable conclusion . shoddily write character who exhibit motive their behavior compromise quality act all around . lack character depth especially diminish Selma Blair 's performance , whose character Shawn vacillate be morose act " cool " and ultimately come confused dolt . be unfortunate , as other circumstance Ms. Blair be appealing and capable actress.Compounding matter worse be director Dana Lustig 's insistence use rapid cut , incongruous special effect ( e.g. look unintentionally hilarious infrared motorcycle chase end ) , and hip soundtrack hope appeal short attention span MTV crowd . certainly Ms. Lustig prove be able master technical side direction , but way do her skill help overcome film 's inherent problem and thus movie drag end . clearly , Lustig have distinct visual style ; however be perhaps well suit music video feature film.The producer ( Ram Bergman & Lustig)can be commend their ability realize film : be able scare up $1.5 million finance film , secure good cast , and get domestic and foreign distribution . be small feat independent film . yet give quality product , result be mixed bag .
film have great cast go : Christopher Lee , Dean Jagger , Macdonald Carey , Lew Ayres -- solid B-movie actor all . but downer movie do n't use sort advantage , none their character even meet screen ( Christopher Lee do get play several scenes).The motivation alien movie seem change drop hat . first , just want repair their ship and leave , then turn main character kill most his friend and notrelease his wife get crucial part need . then , out nowhere , " peaceful " race decide have destroy planet cause too many " disease " ( do offer main character and his wife spot their society).Most film be spend watch man and wife drive or walk or stand around or sit desk do nothing . almost wish have get take out rest planet end , just vengeance bore death.Unless really like Chris Lee or seventy low-budget sci-fi , will give one miss . fall narrow range waste celluloid Star Odyssey and UFO : Target Earth .
This be one bad movie i have ever see . plot be awful , and acting be bad . joke that be attempted absolutley suck . do n't bother waste your time dumb movie such . and reason do want see movie , do n't watch your parent .
agree previous comment , beginning movie be quite good , and get be wander what be come ... ... . which be nothing . open story line remain open ; two character who first seem might be importance be completely leave out picture , save 1 or 2 very short scene . wander Ilya would n't have do well just completely leave out ... . as one remain character , nothing be do either . just visit god-awful place , and suddenly movie be n't anymore , but about geriatric witch who spend their day make doll out bread , drink homemade vodka , and apparently flash other . may say movie do well show society crumble , judge IFFR , but be just bad taste , bad camera-work , lousy script and frightfully bad direction . therefor can notbe as generous my predecessor when come grade : 1 !

Aaron escape Olaris building & go run but be too valuable just let go & full scale search be mount capture ... Directed Yelena Lanskaya be yet Sci-Fi Channel offering that be quite simply put terrible possible way , think probably start out life straight ' Creature Feature ' but end up one most boring & dull Sci-Fi Channel film have see that do n't even feature sort monster or creature . hybrid be awful , script be terrible & be noteven sure who be mean appeal . initial set-up be OK Aaron get Wolf eye but then Hybrid ditch sci-fi element & become sort horrible drama focus entirely Aaron 's mental state wonder do nothing particular native American woman . Yep , do n't think Sci-Fi Channel could make film Wolves & put load rubbish native American mythology there as well do ? dynamics character 's be bizarre , Aaron be show persecute hero yet be only character kill anyone film & be fairly unlikable , ungrateful & annoy person Dr. Hewitt be show evil scientist yet give Aaron back his sight & do nothing but try help . mean Aaron be give back gift sight yet Hewitt be villain ? also regular Sci-Fi Channel staple US military intervention be present , problem be why do want Aaron so badly ? be n't soldier & have Wolves eye help see dark be utterly unremarkable . script ca n't make 's mind up be all Aaron 's mind or be real , ending be hilariously bad half naked ( rememeber be make telly ) Aaron run forest pack Wolves set horrible music think be suppose be emotional but make even more funny . there be so many thing wrong Hybrid , be slow hell , there be virtually action , there be Werewolves & film go round circle try get Aaron 's mind yet be so ridiculous , silly & boring wo n't care one bit & there be never explanation why just have Wolves eye transplant Aaron start develop other Wolf senses.As diabetic have problem my eye , hell have have major surgery my right eye & can guarantee operation your eye would be puff up , would n't be able open & would hurt hell yet have eye transplant as soon Aaron wake up bed his eye be perfect swell or even redness . there be special effect , blood or gore or violence & nothing excite . fact now think there be nothing even remotely horror or sci-fi feeling , feel drab film week.Filmed Manitoba Canada film look OK but be bland & forgettable . acting be poor involve none whom have see before & hopefully never again.Hybrid be terrible film that be obviously market Werewolve ' Creature Feature ' but be far & most people will really struggle get awful ending which will probably have stitch .

say Funky Forest : First Contact be bad movie be understatement incredible proportion . can really get good art house film , even surreal and twisted romp El Topo , Naked Lunch , and Survive Style 5+ , movie actually have something worth discuss when credit roll.FFFC attempt avenue be deep and intellectual , essentially there be substance movie . movie be badly do , visual movie be notinspiring , dialog be bad , musical number destroy movie. . chuckle GUITAR Brothers , but that be immediately wipe out something completely unnecessary , and irrelevant . attempt be deep and meaningful think , but its just pretentious disorient nonsense . freshman film student camera could craft something more interesting.Guitar Brothers and stand up routine skit get 1 point , everything else be just badly pace , pseudo-creative , heavy hand attempt be good film other real director like , Sogo Ishii , David Lynch , and Jodoworsky . give break . be convince people that rave FFFC be do so have idea what see , be nothing but mild pertinent statement here and there mixed stupidity and blend puke your own shoes.This movie be extreme disappointment , come off high that be Survive Style 5+ , film that actually have meaning , combine excellent use scenery , cinematography , catchy dialog , funny moment , good soundtrack , excellent performance , fantastic pace and flow . FFFC feature exact opposite way , boring scenery ( 20 minute stare bland beach night ? completely white stage ? alien ball float white space ? dinky school hallway and then ... school hallway ? ) , terrible cinematography , forgettable dialog , nothing funny or humorous , save fact just waste your life two hour , soundtrack ? , amateurish performance , uneven , disjointed , and often flat drag pace , zero flow whatsoever.There be that claim be what make FFFC great movie , be so unconventional turn its pure genius . be simply way stroke your own ego seem , " unpredictable " could be good quality film be n't couple " boring " , " innane " , and " terrible " . personally have speak two people who admit FFFC be terrible when leave theater , but overwhelming rave art-house elitist make watch movie again and then come back ... " Hey be pretty good like it".I be go put my foot down , movie be slop , do n't care Roger Ebert say film be good thing be ever watch lose his own virginity . " Emperor 's new cloak " say ... movie be way indicative other psychedelic/trippy film come Japan last 10 year . taste Tea , Party 7 , and Kamikaze Girls be much good movie ( even low budget ) , and none can honestly compare Survive Style 5+ . watch FFFC only your interested make pretentious pile nothing shoestring budget .

The Haunting . remake , course . original be creepy psychological thriller , and one that have improve time . compare 1999 remake , be classic . there be character development here , only caricature ( slut , authoritative brain , " be gonna get outta here " fellow , oh so sensitive bookworm ) . but , see how be banking special effect be " star " , guess character can empathize be secondary concern . unfortunately , effect be laughable . mew cherub , stretchy door , irritate dead child that ca n't speak plainly ... and idiotically sappy ending that do be darned give new age enema butterfly and rainbow . ill take my skittle orally , thank .

 Shocking ! 1965 see Jury Gagarin alive . be sincere , unpretentious and kindly , be ease and look well-educated and intellectual person . movie see clown ! actor look dummy affected gesture and mimicry . make cartoon ! real Gagarin be someone else ! do n't believe movie ! see movie movie " Taming Fire " and " Apollo 13 " and reading book " rocket and people " Chertok and " Korolev : myth and fact " Golovanov . be shock tiresome scenario , poor act and produce , and lot inexactitude " Space Race".The movie be tedious rendering well-known Russia historical fact . lot interesting know fact space project be notdemonstrate . fact and detail be pervert . example , 1945 Korolev be already notprisoner ( liberate 1944 ) , and 1940 be already notKolyma prison gold mine , but special prison design bureau . Korolev be designer prison design bureau and be notbury dead prisoner . but movie Korolev work grave digger 1940 ( jailer have shoulder strap uniform ) . IMHO , author movie have profound knowledge part history and ca n't make interesting movie .
have be familiar fantastic book ' Goodnight Mister Tom ' absolutely age and be only recently when get chance watch adaption . have hear lot positive remark , so have high hope . once film have finish , be horrified.This film be notgood film .

be sorry say be one bad film have ever see . visually fascinating ( e.g. use colour be absolutely stunning ) , be pretty boring and disturbing ( see father/son incest).What be more , music be totally absent , and think wonderful soundtrack Michael Nyman ( who write soundtrack most Greenaway 's film ) then can imagine what difference make .
Big hair , big boob , bad music and giant safety pin ... ... .these be word good describe terrible movie . love cheesy horror movie and i have see hundreds..but have get be bad ever make . plot be paper thin and ridiculous , acting be abomination , script be completely laughable(the good be end showdown cop and how work out who killer is-it be just so damn terribly write ) , clothes be sickening and funny equal measure , hair be big , lot boob bounce , man wear cut tee-shirt that show off their stomachs(sickening man actually wear ! ! ) and music be just synthesiser trash that play over and over again ... almost scene there be trashy music , boob and paramedic take away body ... .and gym still do n't close bereavement ! ! joke aside be truly bad film whose only charm be look back disaster that be 80 be and have good old laugh how bad everything be back then .

usually comment only movie like , figure " everyone his/her own taste , " but here want make exception . premise movie , which somehow seem get lose shuffle , be two self-centered adult have perfect right go off Las Vegas , get drunk , get marry , and inflict incalculable suffering their respective brood child . even allow culturally sanction inebriation , have neither courage nor sense responsibility wake up next morning and undo what have set motion . , " love " be all be important , be n't ? hell everybody else . or notthing " work out end " be really notpoint ; fact be quite irrelevant . point be disrespect other , especially be young person , and especially be position dependency , be make light and thereby reinforce movie . there be far more innocuous behavior " parent " could have perform would have bring down army social worker their head heartbeat .
give my money back ! give my life back ! give bit credit . movie be vomit worthy . useless and time consuming . what waste energy and totally pointless . okay understand premise and idea sound but , give break ! next time just give money and let spend . lose child , mother remorse , blame husband !

even could get idea boring character personally witness significant Moment 1960s ( ok , Katie do n't join Manson Family , and nobody die Altamont ) , movie be still unbelievably awful . get impression " writer " just lock room and watch " Forrest Gump , " " Wonder Years , " and Oliver Stone 's 60s film and again and call research . Canadian television critic call conclusion first episode " head spinning " . be right .
 SPOILERS AHEADThis be one bad movie ever make - be simple . there be notone redeeming quality movie . first 10 minute be quite tricky - actually lead believe film will be shocking and will have edge your seat . instead , will spend 83 minute punch watch stolen and poorly make scene run organization . lake be ridiculous , look aquarium , and have same plant different part lake bed . character show their advanced teleportation power , example Alex Thomas who fall lake ( drunk ) , and then end up his boat impossible position . Angie Harmon put up pitiful performance Kate , make bad space-time continuum rupture dialog that appear have be write last minute fifth grader . example would be when say , " Flashlight ! " such stupid manner show threshold how much human body can cringe snap half . finally , edit movie be far most bizarre and horrific have ever see . be cameraman be bunch chimp who have be give camcorder scientist . example would be when suddenly get closeup headlight Alex 's car . would bet there be little time spend edit movie . end be absolutely pathetic . writer be obviously try create sort mysterious plot line that make viewer say , " oh yeah ! " instead , be leave view dumb painting spider that somehow fit story line . unfortunately , there be notone perspective million there that could save movie be fester piece crap.I give .5 out 10 , .5 being fact movie be record film instead become picture book .
about halfway through , realize do n't care character least ; however , watch bit more anyway . regrettably , come back next day and finish . should n't have bothered.If know *anything* film beforehand , know lead character will be plane crash survivor - and title give pretty good idea what be gonna happen afterward - be gonna get phone and call people ! be almost as bad " Snakes Plane " ( bad aviation catastrophe flick).I realize be old film , and act style day be much less naturalistic today . but even standard , act be embarrassing . be n't character , be stereotype . suspect movie be , more anything , attempt Bette Davis help her husband 's ( Gary Merrill ) career . avail however - have see oak tree display more genuine emotion did.Davis ' play happy cripple ( i.e. , non-glamorous role ) be probably look edgy and bold career move . be n't . be just boring . be kind Tiny Tim film , make Trask ( Merrill 's character ) see truth love and forgiveness ( be less winsome Tiny Tim ) , calmly dispense wisdom life and relationship hint her beloved husband have just died.The final scene , where Trask call his wife back Iowa reconcile , be so affect and over-acted end phone line , almost cringe . have remind people actually get pay what be do film.I notice lot people seem have enjoy movie . find uplift , that be great . but frankly , just find bad . there be plenty old movie Golden Age Hollywood that be far well write and act .
film start slowly when get cinema think look quite good but about 5 min be all bore out our mind and wonder what kind film have come see , i do n't like film and would n't recommend anyone , good part night be when alarm and light come back project break down think could all go home . have be one bad film i have ever see be all bore out or mind and most people cinema actually RAN out door end be so rubbish . i be surprise one walk out earlier . go and see make sure something keep busy , well still do n't go and see .

 SNL be pretty funny but people who say be watch short skit SNL be little dumb mind . be NOTHING SNL , be just stupid piece crap.Andy Samberg try act Jon Heder but fail . Jon Heder be only funny Napoleon Dynamite Andy try his hard and people think be funny.Only funny people movie be Danny McBride and Bill Hader . only part that be decently funny Andy be pool part.They could have make " Quiet place " lot well do n't make fall scene 3 freak minutes.The part where be pronounce his H 's more be retarded . try go too long and half time look Andy be laugh act ... be horrible actor and do n't deserve be movie.This movie be joke and be simple minded people brain 10 year old level comedy . which be about half United States .
be look forward see movie read positive review New York Times . addition , be also Shanghainese so there be more just pass interest subject matter . however , watch , be extremely disappointed.The movie 's pace be excruciatingly slow and monotonous . director linger certain scene much too long . there be passion or chemistry lover . there be barely dialogue . dialogue be sorely need compensate lack act . end movie , do n't feel compassion character . movie be lack everything . script be weak , act be poor , and edit be non-existent . director try emulate certain noir film style but fail miserably . good movie be one which capture your attention , maintain and be successful conclude feel time have pass . movie feel as would never end . do n't waste your money movie .
feel have be have , con be , do n't fall . read glowing review ( Director be film reviewer sky year so must have lot mate press ready do favour write favorable review ) expect solid acting , atmosphere , suspense , strong characterization , intriguing plot development and poetic moment . sadly , ' Sixteen year Alcohol ' , do n't deliver critic promise , most part , sacrifice quality lieu cheesy low budget special effect ( what be clichd cobweb scene there ? ) , unrealistic fight choreography and mindless mind numb narration , clich edit and camera angles.'Sixteen year Alcohol ' start off interestingly beautiful location shot Scotland , but be straight downhill here . unfortunately , instead spend time building atmosphere , create character might care about , or build suspense - director opt begin drive crazy self indulgent heavy hand twaddle voice-over 's . lead character be so unsympathetic and be so badly act - audience do n't care what happen , desperate actor do desperate thing ... movie ! . make matter worse , the ' homage be ' ( typical director try pay his due past master ) be either utterly clich or unconvincing . soundtrack be only thing that lift and keep cinema but even that fail support dramatic narrative other connect period time action.For reason movie get increasingly flawed and be quite honest annoy . still watch whole damn thing ! guess like attempt gritty realism film but even that be destroy when be often inter-cut weird and abstract , sometimes pointless scene . do n't need huge budget make truly move film , so much have be say about how little money have make film , half million be notlittle bit money ... So No EXCUSES ! sometimes wonder what actor ... or their agent be think ! pass turkey be masochistic or mindless anyway ... .NOT My THING1.negative
too bad low can go here be one . otherwise would get easy zero . truly one bad film have ever see . fact be Peckenpah 's name notthing would never have guess do . actually one people San Francisco know be set lot and nearly sunup say Sam be just plain snockered . show spade . laughing bit early part film be only thing entire mess worth second look . noteven Gig Young be watchable . be true test masochism . have be force confine theatre see would have jump up scream . and now truly feel guilty have watch confine very comfortable couch that be just too nice leave . what mess , seem less write make up go along . be notonly bomb but bmob spell backwards . yike ! ! ! ! !
irritate , illogical flow event . pretty much joke be so simple can hardly be regard one . wonder cinema be empty and people actually walk away , yes away . stay , be enjoy wonderful ice-cream nut whole movie .
exception Family , new season be bad Season One . ca n't imagine what be think . fan horror , can tolerate lot gore and mindless mayhem , but series get bad outing . ca n't imagine how dishearten must be actor and crew go work day , toil churn out such crap . story ! be too much ask ? character ! how can give damn fate ANYONE story ? be notengage , who care get carve up or whatever ? almost episode end mindless blood let , go gross shock sense revelation or conclusion or Reason why have be subject hour bloodletting . even Dante 's effort season have disturbing sexist violence and wander off pointless conclusion . ironically , production value and performance tend be up speed , content be utter crap . have great hope Exec Producer 's Garris 's Valarie UNDER THE Stairs , but shall see .
once while , movie will sweep stun , draw in , awe , and , end , leave renewed belief human race artistry form . be not. be action movie that lack convincing action . stink . rent something else .
first half be OK , but last half really , really disappoint . be funny producer even admit do n't have clue ending , and really show . Whats really sad be i have write ten line comment minimum be able post . really do n't want include spoiler qualify my remark show be n't really worth effort . when Battlestar galatica first come be really excite prospect good remake , do n't happen first season border be space porn . eventually clean up bit and actually have pretty fair drama , so start watch again . but end series kara be cyclon god angel , same baltar and six be pretty dumb .
be really horrify eerie movie . what unusual dark atmosphere . and such creepy musical score . really promising ! indeed , ten minute really start sweat , and feel uncomfortable , start fear bad . movie have atmosphere true nightmare , and what be worse-it all come out . one hour and half have be try fight complete boredom and fall asleep , but monstrous soundtrack keep awake . Nuit noire be truly horrify picture - your eye , your ear , your intelligence , and most : your wallet , thought spend precious money movie ticket cheap amateuristic homevideo be big horror .
begin , want briefly say movie and be very well make and well act involve , include Whittaker , who indeed deserve his nomination . be highly entertaining , and . . . take right context work FICTION , be very good movie . , give two stars.However , rather waste your time what can read hundred time elsewhere , want instead point out absolute fictional nature film and how dangerous be sell people work fiction as be truth . stress film nowhere credit let know main character , Dr. Nicholas Garrigan , be complete invention fiction . rather , present character real historical setting , and allow uninformed viewer assume be fact real , and what be see be truth . have problem blending fact and fiction - but do so such dishonest matter be , word , reprehensible.There can be doubt Africa , most Third World Countries be rife human misery and suffering . Hollywood have long attempt capture suffering people country film . but Hollywood also have its eye make money . only true way capture suffering that seem happen everywhere but West be either experience , or least have capture honest documentary.But depiction fictional character real historical setting can only do so much . end day , become less present fact viewer decide , and more about lead image image and hit head scream , " See , WE tell WAS Bad ! " seminal example can be find anyone willing watch documentary DVD sit movie . arguably most shocking image film be viewing body Kay Amin , Idi 's second wife , whom kill when discover her infidelity . film , see her limb have be sever and reattach reverse ( arm leg and vice-versa ) . be director make sure understand Amin be , Gungans say , Bom-bad ! but watch documentary , learn be fact nothing more myth , which sit Minister Health time tell be nottrue.So . . . what . . . just MAKE thing ? why ? Hollywood have low opinion our intelligence , that be why ! do n't trust come right conclusion . look , be murder and dismember be enough conclude Amin be notlikable guy portray medium - do n't need Texas chainsaw MASSACRE inspire imagery reinforce ! and be just tip iceberg . what be also notexplain casual viewer be lead character Garrigan be fictional . there be young Scottish doctor take Amin 's wing . such , Garrigan be clearly present only sake help dumb westerner understand African world . producer seem thing wo n't be interested film Africa there be white face . ( Ironically , even titular character be portray American black actor ! ) problem be movie be no long expose Amin and his regime , but instead exploitative thriller white Westerner come Africa all wrong reason , make several horrible mistake , and then " redeem " , even cost three other innocent life . honestly , have say be nearly reprehensible suggest real tragic death Mrs. Amin be result tryst fictional Scottish doctor - almost seem become morbid joke sake entertainment ! really wish Hollywood would stop jerk around our money . first realize its propensity do woefully manipulative beautiful mind , Ron Howard and Akiva Goldsman 's sugary-sweet adaptation life John Nash , which delete dark side man present only tortured hero America just ca n't get enough . sad truth be Hollywood have be sell fake year , and viewer , who be predictably and understandably too lazy or uncare investigate , buy fake portrait hook , line , and sinker.Look , be certainly notsuggest Amin be be turn villain be n't . my point be , truth be so shocking enough convince brutality man , why must Hollywood then go such fictional length ? why must Hollywood continue insult hold our hand film ? why can nottrust think ! ? can notjust put honest portrayal screen and let audience decide ? urge who continue watch Hollywood 's purportedly " true " movie do favor ALWAYS investigate , and Never assume what be screen be even close truth !
do n't even know where begin one . " be all family . " that have be bad line dialogue ever hear " horror " movie , could n't be horror movie even try ! ! ! Ugh ! ! ! and know Owen Wilson be good actor . need stop play token guy who die action movie ( Anaconda , Armageddon ) . , man do co-write " Bottle Rocket " and " Rushmore . " do have talent . also , Lily Taylor should stick indie film . have place here . finally , Catherine Zeta-Jones should become porn star . there be room legitimate act . be serious . One bad movie have ever see , EVER .
have walk out very few movie end , but could n't finish piece garbage . be big load racism try pass legitimate film " Birth nation " . character be little more cardboard cutout . do n't see how actor would want their name associate film . Lee must have good thing do put out garbage . know and anyone brain have good thing do ... . watch paint dry . wish someone would make film interracial relationship that deal topic realistically . there be lot more depth subject shallow rant bitter director Lee .
Very unnecessary movie character that be act so unsympathetically really do n't care who would fare good ( or be purpose film , portray smooth talk cold-hearted New York city folk ? ) romance here , comedy either . act be very flat and very predictable plot . what annoy most be constant joke quote classic movie . man , ca n't see more quote , less significant your own movie become ? try be original ! small budget be excuse , first-time director neither . Crappy , crappy , crappy . wonder only cost one buck ...
This story have different angle that intrigue , enough buy previously-viewed VBS sight-unseen . be mistake.In what could have be very nice story - about badly cripple people hospital , and their various personality - turn quickly very profane soap opera unlikeable characters.We have " Bloss " ( William Forsythe ) stereotype racist white person , who say f-word other sentence and be so despicable do n't give first name movie . be lot fun be around . then , there be " Raymond Hill " ( Wesley Snipes ) , fast-talking womanizer . Snipes must have like fast-talking " hip " arrogant role play number , " White Men Ca n't Jump .

foolish , implausible tale be redeem only opening scene which hard-boiled police detective deliver nearly-audible line confirm our great fear : be dead . perhaps film would have be save have director forgo dazzling star power A. Martinez favor sadly-anonymous actor who fill screen brief moment . no-name hack-tor street could salvage such dishwater film be no less likely villain commit murder drop stone quarry unsuspecting diver . his moment be brief ; his promise be immense . perhaps will be treat more screen time obscure Thespian there be ever sequel ill-advised film .

think movie be pretty lame . be look cheesey , may like . , , do n't mind fair amount cheese , but be ridiculous . progression movie bore and storyline be very weak.The only thing entertain movie be day-glo zombie , but even that be n't reason enough see flick .
admit , have come age hippie-dippy age , be sucker kind movie . can enjoy schlock hippie genre far more most " normal " people . however , movie be simply awful conceivable way.Every trite perception hippie silliness be present gospel , cop kill young long hair when peacefully land plane . movie be so horrible be noteven funny watch goof excess hippie drone . be left wing version Dragnet , professional actor . only reason give two star be there be obscurity interest soundtrack , besides , could n't find selection negative stars.No actor , almost plot , sheeze , barely even script ... get , " art " movie ... .All do root canal drilling slowness , drag out meaningless scene just fill up time.In bizarre twist life imitate art , star " nonactor " movie join commune real life and rob bank Boston , one his co-robbers be kill and be send jail where be kill suspicious weightlifting " accident " ... ..and just think , get leave behind legacy ... .Oy vey .
movie be hilarious , notgood way . fight be awfully bad do , sometimes will try shock break bone , and even happen only two or three time , definitely notenough call shockmovie . gunfight mean hero can walk open field 10 people shoot Uzi 's , pick up gun , start shoot back and notget hurt.The story empty , guy wake up , lose his memory , start fight cos that be what be good . Five year late memory come back , take revenge blablabla.Not your buck , notreally worth your time be drink and bore .
film look interesting ; will read book number year ago and inform feature follow plot outline pretty tightly.Started watch and almost outset fail live up expectation . fact , do n't bother watch whole thing ... utter drivel - bad performance , bad acting and instantly dislikeable character - that be point film , guess.Watching film leave bad taste mouth and put downer remainder my weekend.Do notbother feature .
series be one bad show have ever see . terrible acting , terrible effect , terrible writing , get my drift . story be so far legend Robin Hood be amazing . look like just want use name Robin Hood attract audience . might as well have be call New Adventures Mr. Bland Acting.Someone comment have imagination , will love show . be horrible approach TV-series . visual medium should spark your imagination , should n't have force your imagination something make good . would be Simpsons episode where try brainwash Homer religious propaganda movie , and start talk who kill who or whatever . " movie be boring , just make up my own story."In conclusion : absolute human waste .
be create movie thermometer , movie would be absolute zero . out ten star , would rate follows:Plot : zero star Video quality : zero star Sound Quality : zero star acting : zero starsIt be as high school student get together one afternoon camera , make up plot and shoot movie . be so lack artistic value will rather watch kid walk high school watch movie.HOWEVER , something be be say abysymal depth . " shootout " staircase be one most train-wreck funny scene ever . first , combatant simply wave plastic gun other , jerk their arm back and forth simulate recoil . pair actually " duck " other 's non-existent bullet . squib , spark , blank , just wave spraypainted squirtguns around . want see two grown man play " actor " , give spin someday ... have clean fridge , comb carpet , polish doorknob , rake gravel , straighten book shelf , etc.
sit glue screen , rivet , yawn , yet keep attentive eye . wait next awful special effect , or next ridiculously clichd plot item show up full force , so could learn how notmake movie.It seem when set out make movie , crew watch single other action/science-fiction/shoot-em-up/good evil movie ever make , and see cool thing and say : " hey , can do . " example , only car park mile what seem one way road shoulder notmean parking , be one car protagonist , attractive brunette bear bile , be throw on . car blow piece even land . special effect be quite obviously my big beef movie . but what really put my bad book be implausibility , and lack reason so many element ! example , antagonist , fly demon ability inflict harm bizarre way , happen lone army truck transport important VIP . nameless security guy gun get out truck , know be already dead . then guy protect VIP say " circumstance do leave truck , do understand ? " get out find beast that kill his 3 buddy , get whack almost comically clich fashion . then apparent reason , defy logic , convention , and common sense , dumb ass VIP GETS Out Truck ! ! ! lot what happen course movie do n't make sense . transparent acting distance movie , as well bad camera-work , and thing that just make go : " wow , that be incredibly cheesy . " Shiri Appleby save movie 1 , give movie one element that always make viewer enjoy experience , sex appeal .
can believe woodenly write and direct piece cliche film get make . there be about four good look shot ( director should think about switch still photography ) and be . strong cast be utterly waste , scene repeatedly end least interesting moment and script say nothing new . please spare movie .
cast be OK . script be awkward time , and take while figure out what point movie be . find look forward do dish . Shehan bit be cheesy statement war . guess be suppose notnotice ... do . its house , do nothing more kill forty five minute . shower part ... Huh ? what be about ? literally , be have client , " Ok can use our shower . " Yawn . angle be try way hard . there be set wood , suddenly its go cause can see right through , then next be deep and animal be die . end be horrendous movie boring proportion .
, also have endure hundred child 's movie past , consider be one bad have ever seen.1 ) resent day and age have explain my child Russia be not" bad guy " . also , mock Russian name " Poopchev " be inappropriate.2 ) grandfather fly 's birthday party scene contain quasi-sexist joke which imply male drink beer and woman talk phone . Two other fly also needlessly use word " crap " twice.3 ) whole movie largely smack 1950 's stereotype and propaganda think , nation , be proud have rise above.In all be just crude , badly animate , even more badly write and notworth waste time view .
let serve warning anyone wish draw attention medium link their name well-loved and well-respect , notsay revere author , order draw attention their home-movies out DVD.Hyped sky its obviously talentless maker , fact lie about only be reveal , finally , ludicrously inept department , fan Wells and his book have be blood its Writer-Producer-Director appear DVD.Many good point have be make other comment user page . particularly one use teaching aid Film School student , " film " do noteven use basic grammar script , edit , continuity , direction its entire 3 hour run time . be possible Director do show up shoot . certainly there be no-one present who know even remotely what be doing.An ongoing thread continue evolve IMDb page which should least furnish watcher witless drivel few laugh their $9.00 outlay.Much be promise . absolutely nothing be deliver . " Monty Python Meets " War Worlds " all humour take out.Indefensible trash . just unbelievable.There be real independent film-makers out there be check out . people who actually try work high standard instead flap their gum about how great their movie be go be.People could do worse keep eye Brit film-maker Jake West 's " Evil Aliens " example .
be honest , do n't " Executive Decision " - which be obvious template - very much , but compare piece crap , look masterpiece art.Not only people move film ( term actor would be insult other actor ) should attend more acting class , guy who build setting have n't even see aircraft afar . be so ridiculous , 747 only 3 flight attendance be aboard , but be only tip iceberg . film be full illogicalness ( e.g. : use sleeping-gas , then do n't use , then use anyway ) , which drop my rating finally bottom.You can have more fun rearrange sock drawer or drill hole your knee and fill milk .

ordinary movie-watcher ca n't say enjoy watch one . be nottoo emotional drama , nottoo gripping thriller , nottoo fast action . plus , moment movie be hardly credible . OK , understand , soldier become bit out their mind there , but be hard believe person would risk his life , carjack middle hostile city , and be shout professor 's wife run away , have ask question ( proper way ) . would seem terribly romantic be animation or so , but be suppose be serious film war. . there be several episode , so whole picture make impression be just raw preview movie , and need considerable work.It feel movie maker want create image emotional brave soldier , but these ' curve ' his psychology seem simply unnatural.This picture leave question my head : why ? why give Oscar ? why Six ? and IMHO be most thrilling part movie : )
My life be about save animal . do volunteer work cat rescue organization . be vegetarian could n't kill animal even sustain my life . ca n't even kill spider , put outdoors . scene where child throw rock bird die , Sooner participate attempt be accept other child , make sick and have haunt ever since . simply convince human being be pathetic their need acceptance . ending - foster parent adopt Sooner - do notredeem depiction animal cruelty . why would anyone want their child see film ?

be really hope would be funny show , give all hype and clever preview clip . and talk hype , even hear interview show 's creator BBC World Today - show that be broadcast all world.Unfortunately , show do n't even come close deliver . joke be obvious - kind sound kind funny first time hear but that seem lame - and be notgive new treatment or twist . character be one-dimensional . acting be - well - mediocre ( be be nice ) . be classic CBC recipe - one that always fails.If be Muslim think would have be stupid believe white character , and be white will probably be offend little fact almost all white character be portray bigoted , ignorant , or . notmake fun white people be problem - most good comedy be root . be only problem when be n't funny - as show.Canada be burst funny people - so many export Hollywood regular basis . so how come producer show could n't find ?
Stan Laurel become small half all-time great comedy team , labour contract Broncho Billy Anderson series cheapies , many which be parody major Hollywood feature . follow dispute Anderson , Laurel continue informal series parody Joe Rock 's small ( and more indigent ) production company.Most Laurel 's parody film be only mildly funny time , and even less funny modern audience who have n't see original movie which Laurel be parody . ' West Hot Dog ' be fairly generic parody cowboy shoot-'em-ups . be marginally specific parody ' West Pecos ' , oater release two year earlier major actor . ' West Pecos ' be never huge success , be difficult see why Stan 's film unit choose particular movie target their lampoonery , much less why wait so long its release parody . and where do get title ' West Hot Dog ' ? possibly be down fact that ' hot dog ! ' be sexual interjection favour American lecher 1920s . ( opening scene stage play ' Machinal'.)'West Hot Dog ' be produce and co-directed Joe Rock . his many other achievement , Rock introduce Laurel Lois Neilson , and be subsequently good man their wedding . full disclosure : last year his life , have great privilege befriend Joe Rock and interview . nearly ninety year old time , Rock 's memory be impressively clear ... but remember nothing about ' west Hot Dog ' , and ca n't blame . movie be eminently forgettable.The lead lady 's character be name Little Mustard : that be mean be parody something ' West Pecos ' , do n't get . there be couple ' impossible ' gag here , include Laurel 's method mount horse . just one moment movie , Stan Laurel remind great Buster Keaton when suddenly break run . ' West Hot Dog ' be vaguely similar subject matter and tone Keaton 's short comedy ' Frozen North ' , but Keaton 's version be much funny . plot film somewhat anticipate situation Keaton 's feature ' Our Hospitality ' but ( again ) suffer comparison : here , two tough varmint brother expect inherit last Chance Saloon , but previous owner have bequeath weakling tenderfoot Stan . however , brother will become legal heir Stan die . hmmm ... Seriously , though : be such bequest legal ? as soon Stan take possession property , surely further question ownership or inheritance become his decision , notprevious owner 's decision . have plenty time consider such point law watch dull comedy.At one point , gag involve crude animation draw directly film stock . look cheap and be n't funny.This ' Hot Dog ' be weiner , and winner : be just whiner . my rating : one point out 10 . Hang on , Stan : few more year will be one-half comedy legend .

Pintilie , who 40 year ago make very good movie ( " Duminic la ora sase " ) follow one , nice enough ( " Reconstituirea " ) , try declare his film-lenghts " art work " - but , unfortunately , master way too limit level specifically cinematographic mean expression . such , " Niki Ardelean " offer again sample " How not" - being its only merit .

Appollo 13 be near-loss , but two real disaster happen liftoff and re-entry , respectively . case , compare shuttle Saturn rocket be somehow ... well , okay , just plain stupid . even ignore , successful shuttle mission seem nothave be deem interest audience.14 ) what hell be up UFO ? even context movie , make sense . assume be make entertainment purpose , aim specific audience ( which seem include people next understanding history , science , or rhetorics).Even point movie be somewhat obscure . Catch-phrases " cover up now " , " publically reveal here first time " , come up , but film do n't place blame or offer lesson or anything , which could be expect film so emotionally do . good old tradition sensationalism , there be numerous interview shot and recording fragment that be often out context or people know nothing about " NASA scientist " . wow , so astronaut be very nervous endeavor ? fancy that . what do this have do point movie again ? oh yeah , which point.In summary , addition be either willfully or incompetently inaccurate , be noteven good entertainment . and believe , be guy who enjoy his crappy documentary ; film be n't funny , witty , quaint , be nothing .

( predictably ) bomb . story be laughable and date today 's standard . even Midler and Alvarado give good performance film really drag and be bore silly end . Stephen Collins and Marsha Mason ( both good actor ) do n't help support role . flimsy and dull . Really--who think would work ? see 1937 Stanwyck version instead . give 1 .
 Cruel Intentions 2 be bloody awful , mean uber-bad . word can notexplain how bad be , but will give go anyway.The plot Cruel Intentions 2 be very similar first film . Sebastian ( Robin Dunne ) , be kick out private school and be force move New York . there decide make fresh start and just life normal life and settle down . unfortunately have deal his step-sister Kathryn ( Amy Adams ) want drag down . Sebastain start fall love Danielle ( Sarah Thompson ) , innocent daughter Headmaster school . Kathryn want Sebastain just sleep around whole school which have be describe ' whore-house ' . Kathryn also want get revenge Cherie ( Keri Lynn Pratt ) , who humiliate school assembly . Kathryn want make freshman big slut school , similar sub-plot first film.Cruel Intentions 2 be basically cancel TV-show , which be turn prequel . there be so many problem film . be poorly written , unfunny , and badly act . luckily Amy Adams show never take off now be fairly big actress . Cruel Intentions have sense realism and can be see be set real world , Cruel Intentions 2 be set sitcom land and as describe amazon.co.uk ' randy version Saved Bell ' . there be dark theme involve sex and drug use first film , but Cruel Intentions 2 try make funny and idea film should n't be , such Kathryn have affair teacher . other idea also do n't work such secret society where all popular kid meet discuss downfall other student . film also have major problem sexualised 15/16-years-old . know teenager do have sex , sometimes lot , but when do film or television , be treat very seriously . One famous sense be when Daneille encourage Cherie ( who be around 14/15 film ) simulate sex back horse point where have orgasm . idea turn girl 14/15 slut be just very wrong , and should n't be make subject comedy . joke film fall flat , be verbal gag ' go all moist when see ' visual gag where Sebastian push Kathryn face first mud.There be lot wrong film , which do n't have time go , but say should be avoid . just watch Cruel Intentions , notclassic , still be decent film and treat subject matter well.This film be just pervert 's wet dream , have school-kids have lot sex other .

 Simply put : movie be boring . Clich clich be confirm and story line never come together . seem as director be unsure make movie or documentary . main plot be very thin ( CIA agent be order kill oil prince , get catch and then warn prince ( why ? ) ) and therefore element be add make movie more interesting . so , kid die , which result " natural " response father : freely advise person indirectly responsible his son 's death . lawyer have drunk " friend " and keep around , why , one know . kid become suicide terrorist and blow up ship.All , be one bad movie have see quite while . be neither entertain nor intellectually challenge . neither laugh nor cry , do notgain understanding nor be compel learn more or take up cause . mean nothing , which my eye be bad can say movie .

" whore mangler " title be angry low budget filmmaker who murder bunch hooker . there be little nudity and erection , but single element could possibly save hangman 's noose . lighting be appalling , dialog be puerile and mostly shout , and direction be clueless . see doco American exploitation filmmaker recent Fangoria convention .

Oh , what bad , bad , very bad movie ! Cowritten and star Sylvester Stallonethat should have be enoughand feature too many rock-climbing scene , vertigo , fall , and scene-chewing villain and botched airborne heist . there be two plot , lame . involve traumatic failed rescue , and other involve bad people wreck airplane booty , and kill various harmless people whenever possible . usually reliable John Lithgow , perhaps depress sheer awfulness product , be reduce sneer and call whom do n't care " Bostid ! " vague approximation English accent . Janine Turner , who be sprightly and enigmatic when play Maggie Northern Exposure , be sadly waste part rescue climber and pilot . Stallone be stolid and muscle-headed . deathless line one . live line , either .
start , let say my experience movie might have be influence dubbing , which gather other comment be original one which be consider inferior . so , be entirely possible subtitle or apparently new DVD version would make difference . have also notread corresponding book ; be only familiar one other Japanese manga and might be lack cultural context.Potential minor spoiler ahead.I usually darkly ting science fiction story ( likes Blade Runner , 12 monkey , etc. ) , but do notenjoy movie . start out mildly intriguing , become tedious time be only half-way finish . there be sort problem ; let be start what be probably most severe : dialogue . character seem unable formulate complete sentence ; be n't shout other 's name n-th time , be usually grunt monosyllable ( " Kanedaaa ! " , " Tetsuoooo ! " , " Huh ? " , " Grrr " , etc. ) . leave most character entirely underdeveloped and two-dimensional . do n't help least lot get only few minute screen time anything interesting say that would develop away stereotype suggest visuals.The grunt be augment random pseudo-philosophical technobabble that sound vague and uninspired even Star Trek standard . there be nothing deep and meaningful here - all seem haphazard , throw together random various bit and piece stock sci-fi idea coherency whatsoever.What little there be intelligible plot be no more excuse begin overlong final sequence which consist escalate scene mayhem and destruction . notthere be anything wrong nice bit mayhem and destruction , course ; but case will find ask " what be point , and how long be over " . character development last 30 minute or so consist little more Tetsuo turn Pizza Hutt readily apparent reason.The ending resemble one 2001 - bizarre string image that , far resolve or explain anything , leave viewer feeling have just be look kaleidoscope two hour . be sure will claim sort thing be art ; but be just lot admittedly imaginative use colour and shape . ( music be also quite interesting ) . unfortunately be style and substance.Tired Disney ? want watch animated movie deal intelligently " adult " theme ? be sad say be more likely find sort thing " South Park " .
original titillate intellect , cheap remake be design purely shock sensibility . instead intricate plot-twists , so-called thriller just feature sudden and seemingly random story change that serve only debase further bizarre development . bad , replace original spicy dialog be overturn saltshaker full unnecessary four-letter word , leave stark , but uninterest taste.There be promise--unfulfilled promise . prospect Michael Caine pull off Patty Duke-like Keller-to-Sullivan graduation be admittedly intriguing . unfortunately , brilliant and respected actor only tarnish his reputation , first accept role horribly re-scripted nonsense and then turn performance that only look competent when compare Jude Law 's amateurish overacting.If have n't see classic original , overlook its dated visual and gimmick . hunt down , watch , and just enjoy story-and-a-half . as remake , pass insult original .
no laugh whatsoever . yes , watch entire train wreck but only so would n't later wonder Cleese have come his sense latter part . ( no , have not.)This may be historically interesting youngster there , see British " humor " include black " joke " , thirty year ago.What amaze even more though , be read other reviewer ' comment , which acknowledge be n't very good , yet then turn around and give high vote . vast majority comedy have see be even much bad one , then certainly pity your torturous existences.The humor level show appear aim little kid , yet subject matter do not. so who be ? people who enjoy repeated & drawn-out double-takes , pratfall , drug joke ( interest only short trip back ' 77 ) , and other " low " humor . Three Stooges be still funny , and be kid , too . exert effort make joke work . however be slough schlock . fear be end civilization , stuff really be accept worthwhile . next will be tell tabloid TV be popular . :(

once again , Disney manage make child 's movie which totally ignore its background . only thing common and original Gadget cartoon be name . most glaring error be character - Penny do nothave her book , Brain have be reduce character fancy prop , Dr Claw be more show-off evil villain , etc. but there be more . horror start first minute film - have Gadget security guard call John Brown do n't help identify classic Inspector Gadget . and right beginning see Disney 's blatant attempt turn story ever love affair man and woman - introduce Brenda , who only serve make movie Disney-compatible . add fact " Claw " see film and classic Dr Claw be almost diagonally opposite and will see be go be nowhere original storyline . what would help would be good storyline replace - but as guess , Disney fail too . whole movie be just gadget act silly silliness 's sake and lust Brenda . add insult injury , Disney introduce " new " Gadgetmobile - do n't look , function or think old Gadgetmobile , be just canonical " comic relief " figure . Disney obviously recognise Gadget cartoon be comedy , so make film comedy too , but take out all clever running gag ( assignment paper explode Chief 's face ) and replace Gadget be moron , Gadgetmobile be wise-ass , and " Claw " show off . someone should tell Disney " child 's movie " do n't imply " total lack brain usage " . gadget should be target child 10-12 year ... notchild 10-12 month movie . whatever movie be suppose be , be not, repeat not, real Inspector Gadget . love old Gadget , hate .
have severe problem show , several actually . simple list will suffice now , will go more depth later on : superficial character , laugh-track and boring humour.If do n't wish look rest review and be only read can feel superior ( as see anything show do n't ) frequently irk teen Canada will summarize : Friends suck , notonly be unfunny but destroy TV audience new , good show ( Arrested Development , Dexter etc. ) . Friends be as much blame reality TV , " Two and Half Men " and " King Queens " television executive . now then , review.These character have soul , be exactly same way ( gender and hair colour ) . react same way boring situation and be completely secure their own body . where be conflict and humour that come ? why be n't Rachel storm out Monica Monica start hang out Rachel 's enemy ? why do n't Joey contemplate suicide nobody seem take seriously ? oh right , cause be dumb one and be comfortable . be curse have perfect character : lasting conflict and ( god forbid ) personality become impossibility.The laugh-track be one thing that should have die out right be bear . show that have be almost certainly opposite funny . how can make such broad generalization ? when show that claim be " comedy " require laughter someone BESIDES THE AUDIENCE must mean audience would notlaugh . Laughtracks destroy humour prevent quick comeback . humour become construct rather free flowing entity ( see Office , Arrested Development).This lead my next point : humour be boring . there be way make perfect character anything more slightly humorous ( laugh-track apparently ) simply our everyday humour come recognition our flaw . so what Monica date 17 year old ? immediately recognize what be do be n't right and break up . there have be sort conflict rather immediate solution . maybe her mother find out or one her friend try get rid and end seduce . would be great , would be custody battle ! so now have provide evidence my position . many my friend love show have n't hear Curb your enthusiasm or Arrested Development , many my friend hate show recently start watch Curb your enthusiasm or Arrested Development.I have watch very little " friend " my life , but have watch enough spot huge flaw that make show , my opinion , completely unwatchable . have read far , thank , and hope least start watch show have mention .

Gilbert be weak link , but Bonham Carter be suitably beautiful and course can actually act , and rest cast play hilt tongue firmly cheek ( Edward Fox & Diana Rigg )
 Quite honestly , Omega Code be bad movie have see very long time . first 30 minute sit stun my seat , try decide should demand refund . but have n't pay see first place ( pass ) , figure might as well stay . and do n't think could possibly get worse.It do . will quickly run low point ( include spoiler ) : horrible miscast Casper Van Dien Gillen Lane , motivational speaker two PhDs . characterization be inconsistent ; example , Lane , his credential , be complete nitwit . then there be lame-o depiction fulfillment biblical prophecy ; see bunch sensational news soundbites accompany ridiculous computer print out translate Biblical Code . also , terrible " action " sequence : Lane escape tough situation explanation , and one time Lane actually do seem be danger , turn out be dream sequence ! be cute grammar school write assignment , but be inexcusable plot device motion picture . pace be bad : long opener , first third movie change scene 90 second . later , pace improve , but there be still far too much unnecessary jump around . and someone else mention , year pass yet one ( noteven Lane 's young daughter ) age . be disconcerting.There be few good thing , though . quality film ( e.g. lack graininess ) be high and very attractive . outdoor shot be well do and location shooting add touch realism . also , there be few moment last part film when Lane call God ( finally ) help - prove be quite exhilarate - even , someone who do notaccept Jesus personal savior . but like strike be only genuine scene movie . unfortunately , be follow major incomprehensibility.The character , dialogue , direction and acting be ALL poorly do . Michael Ironside have nothing do , and Michael York be just weird . think producer want do too much ; plot have be tight and more focus , and characterization more flesh out , film would have be far better.In nutshell , Omega Code disappoint . definitely do notpay see . give ** out ten star .

think , deep down dark , slimy part their heart , everyone like Jerry Springer just little bit . his show be undeniably offensive and stupid , also give chance see , relatively speak , most have real good . when look trailer park livin ' , dollar whiskey drinkin ' , incest lovin ' people Springer show , make even your bad day seem walk park . Jerry be perform public service , and should be grateful . ditch political career host show , just us.What should notbe grateful way be piece garbage movie " Ringmaster " . " ringmaster " show what life be people who wind up being guest show , or so would like think . movie follow pre-requisite Springer story line : love triangle . One triangle involve Connie , her daughter Angel , and her husband Rusty . other involve Starletta , Vonda , and Demond . when two hapless group meet up LA , their life intertwine and collide head-on , culminate explosive episode Springer show . be what " Short Cuts " would be Robert Altman have have severe crack habit."Ringmaster " be true show , be stupid and offensive start finish . also make very glad do n't live squalor be character do . but movie have problem . be bill comedy , but just be n't very funny . what laugh there be be have be few and far . maybe people watch and laugh non-stop . think blow job and rape be funny , well then guess be one folk . personally , laugh two or three time and spend rest movie utter awe agonize horror white-trash life.The Jerry Springer Show just be n't mean make leap TV silver screen . what be funny hour long show ( less , when count commercial ) be n't necessarily go be funny ninety minute movie . movie have tell story , and be something else " Ringmaster " have trouble . story be threadbare . there be so many plot hole and continuity error attempt tell cohesive narrative be quickly put asunder . and even there be n't such problem , how much fun can pull out story stereotypical people stereotypical story ? even Hollywood formula could n't make well . " ringmaster : be so bad , even screw up good part Springer show : final thought . somehow , even smart and simple aspect show wind up blow hard slutty woman film be build around.The bad offender be Springer . be such bad actor ca n't even play convincingly . watch Springer play Springer be sad . be be go ' what Woody Allen play Jerry Springer ' vibe , and fail . miserably . go trouble produce disaster , least could do be try make just much better.Not be say everyone else movie put award worthy performance . just opposite . all suck . notsurprisingly , no one movie go greatness . good be do be Molly Hagan land job Nickelodeon sitcom . apparently , Nickelodeon have problem hire woman who star most vile film ' 90 be star child 's program . make wonder what kind thing other adult channel have do their pasts.Here be my final thought : what have here be group people self respect and man money burn , who have meet and put their resource together produce film that show how much hate and how little think intelligence their viewing audience . should accept people who make movie that treat like severely brain-damaged lump goo ? say no . somewhere out there , crazy , mixed world , there be perfect movie . just have keep look . next time , take care and your love one . and do n't ever watch " Ringmaster " .
 Words can describe how utterly abysmal movie be . be series random , unfunny clip everything stupid Batman spoof guy get old dead lady ( really disturbing ) . only remotely amusing thing underground Comedy Movie be watch Joey Buttafuoco , good actor movie . also , be rate NC-17 , shun away only people that might tolerate .

there have be many movie feature Bigfoot , majority which be notgood but most least have goofy charm . Sasquatch Hunters do n't even have go . be just crash bore.Sasquatch hunter be about group paleontologist , primatologists , and forest ranger that venture off remote part Pacific Northwest forest . bone belong sort abnormally large primate have be discover region and ape be n't natural North America begin lead scientific expedition . sure enough , soon discover whole burial ground full skeletal remains enormous ape-like creature . think know what happen people that disturb ancient burial ground movies.The first half movie consist uninteresting , interchangeable character assemble their gear , hike wood , stop rest , hike wood some more , pause long enough investigate and discuss few finding way , yet more hike wood , look group member that have vanish , even more hike wood , dig dirt , random theorize , and gather around campfire discuss what little have do day . when Sasquatch finally show just turn people stumble around dark be pick one time ( do blink and miss fashion and actual killing occur off-camera ) . be excruciatingly boring.The movie want be take seriously and director be clearly try build suspense but there be none be find , thus be leave dull , draw scene people wander wood just get somewhere and wander around wood night try act scare . will be lie say do n't make liberal use fast forward button speed scene up.As Sasquatch , much other character else movie , do n't have much do and lack distinct personality . look shaggy version King Kong , which be n't all bad scene where use CGI instead man Bigfoot costume , which be painfully obvious daylight monster scene . part ca n't help but feel even use computer effect bring Bigfoot life be tad sacrilegious . there be single movie monster believe should only be bring life situation , be Bigfoot.This be one movie that do n't so much have plot do premise . be really be , premise , which people involve stretch out make feature length motion picture bother add all ingredient make worthwhile movie .
costume , dialog , historical accuracy be terrible . instance , - Stacey Dash and hang scene . noose be accurate ( as could tell ) , but type noose break person 's neck . Ms. Dash be left hang end rope ill effect rope be shoot . type notdo notstrangle person , kill end drop.And right go rob bank ( flashback ) , pause street group hug - their bandanna hide their face - that would have be obvious people street.The poor edit - that be battery pack shirt and be obvious , clip " long ride " show ride along , then reverse film.I do fact keep scene horse take crap - seem symbolic . entire movie be crap .
" Whipped " be 82 minute long . review be 82 word long . Three unlikable New York Lotharios , ruthless " scammer , " end up woo same woman , play Amanda Peet , disastrous result . apply story and film . too sophomoric be misogynistic , flaccid and ridiculous , " Whipped " mix philosophy shock jock Tom Lykis Penthouse letter fantasy . technically proficient be date , grate , poorly write , mean , and obvious . people do n't act . people do n't talk . really .
original " Cube " be fantastic B-movie rich paranoia , meaty characterization , and fine over-the-top performance . be creepy , cryptic , and cool . and stand perfectly well , its own , stupid sequel " Cube Zero."This third ( ! ) film Cube series be part retread ( most booby traps be sadly recycle ) , part aberration . take bold step explain what cube be - something that be never reveal first movie - but , say explanation be bland , will rather be keep secret . there be potentially interesting reference society that exist outside cube , but never develop hint kind political-religious totalitarian state . so , what little social commentary there be feel flat and unfocused.What work ? basically nothing . acting be purely amateur hour , pace be slow ( how much movie consist two nerd watch screen ? ) , and gore effect , revolt , fail convince . short , " Cube Zero " remind " Cube " fan-fic , sloppy and sophomoric clone good movie that definitely do notneed sequel .

 Amateur , budget film can be surprisingly good ... however be notone them.Ah , Brad Sykes atrocity . acting be hideous , Emmy Smith who show promise . camera " direction " need serious rework . and more " hold camera and run " gimmick either ; just do n't work . special effect be unimaginative , there be problem when effect can be identify real time . be go rip off ear , please do n't let see actor 's real ear blood . scenery be bland and boring ( same Mr. Sykes other venture ) , and music be cross cheap motel porn and really bad guitar drive metal ( see scenery comment).Did mention lack real plot , or character development ? apparently , scriptwriter didn't.Whoever be fund guy ... please stop . have see his other " home movie " ( which will notplug ) and be just as bad . normally , " director " will grow and learn his previous effort ... notguy . be one thing be amateur filmmaker , but anyone can be hack.Definitely noteven popcorn film ... course , chew popcorn kernel would be less painful effort.Award : bad ever military push-up film .

Steve Martin should quit try do remake classic comedy . absolutely do notfit part . woeful remake Out Towners , movie fall flat 's face . how anybody ever think Steve Martin could even come close Jack Lemmon 's wonderful performance be and same be true movie . Dan Ackroyd could have play Bilko part well . Martin be great when do his own original character but fail miserably try recreate other people 's classic work . be sad statement when funny part movie be contain first line credit when movie be over . line " producer gratefully acknowledge total lack cooperation United States Army " be just only line that actually make laugh . want see real Bilko , get hold original episode Phil Silvers Show . be guarantee make laugh , mistake that should never have happen . put movie same category aforementioned Lemmon classic and remake Psycho . none should ever have happen .
have n't see twenty year . OJ be bus driver , Arte Johnson be tour guide , Lorenzo be kidnapper.Yea , Lorenzo look very much home villain , natural . think watch back then most OJ , who have see tower Inferno and Cassandra Crossing , but also see Arte Johnson.I be little bore Johnson be so serious.And yes , shift plot . read other post , remember that be plot be go kidnap rich girl , but then priceless stamp business turn up blue.I be go , stamp ? come late movie , would probably record check out again , but would n't be nostalgic . notyet anyway.There be good movie seventy check out .
( various spoiler follow)Gene Kelly . notGeorges Guetary , who be sometimes criticize be too young and un-French . notLeslie Caron , who be sometimes criticize her very green performance . noteven Oscar Levant , who more often notannoy dickens out me.No , would definitely be Gene Kelly . there be something his screen persona that be too ambitious and focus be convince penniless artist Paris , content put off face critic indefinitely , frolick little kid and old lady and painting street . be what make so effective SINGIN ' rain and other movie where play ambitious , focused character . Jerry Mulligan be way cousin Tommy Albright BRIGADOON , Lerner story Kelly miscast American loose end who fall love picturesque European place and innocent female who embody its virtues.Except Jerry be n't as likeable even poor daze Tommy . be galling thing film . Jerry be sometimes cad Milo , and even bad Lise . when first see latter club , pull dirty trick get dance . when sit down again pull even dirty trick get her phone number . when call next day hang up , which take cue drop her workplace . and all be obvious want Nothing do . when start laugh his joke perfume shop , be about as believable Milo 's interest his painting . sure be good-looking and playful , but why should that sway when have get Henri , who seem gentleman boot ? admittedly come off so distasteful partly actress . role Lise be play , say , Judy Garland , would shower Jerry indignant insult and glare . be play Cyd Charisse , would admire his gut . but when be play first-timer Leslie Caron look and act shy , vulnerable teenager , and result Jerry just seem creep . and why DID choose other actor ( though personally will rather have solve thing change lead ) when whole story hinge romance two young poor sweetheart disentangle their loveless commitment old rich people ? notonly be Gene Kelly few year Guetary and Foch , be old enough be Caron 's father.In short think all would have be improve cast young comedic-relief type dancer Jerry , kind that usually turn up musical supporting role ... e.g. Ray MacDonald Good News or Bobby Van SMALL Town GIRL . maybe notnecessarily but someone like . someone who could have chase Lise and make seem harmlessly playful ; someone who would have appear genuinely happy living Chaplinesque hole-in-the-wall ; someone whose humor and naivete would have contrast good Oscar Levant 's sarcastic grumpiness . probably also would have make ballet seem less ponderous . and might have provide voice that could sing Gershwin better.All may give impression do n't like Gene Kelly . do . be terrific most his film , just notone ( well , and few other ) . do n't despise AAIP , either ; have good point , art direction . and Leslie Caron , who her inexperience be rather charming , and really do look just step out painting . Georges Guetary do fine job and his " Stairway Paradise " be my favorite number movie . Nina Foch be beautiful and touching and should have end up SOMEBODY . but notJerry Mulligan . would n't wish .
should preface state be Dolph Lundgren fan . man turn out funny action clichs imaginable and Detention be probably my personal favorite . *Spoiler* even there be such thing Dolph spoiler script be so absurd begin : chase scene handicapped kid carry pistol guy Harley sub-machine gun , high school hallway and kid win ? good game , Oscar go Detention . Dolph , be read , thanks laugh , old friend.In summary : terrific movie that be guarantee laugh . recommend invite friend and force sit . hilarious .
 Somehow sum up 60 be , ten year that radically change our country , four hour . and what painful four hour be . trivilized major event and happening and " claim " be about two family yet barely see african-american family . be NBC would be ashamed and embarrassed air such trash . what be amuse be happy-go-lucky family see very beginning be torture so many way , but manage attend major 60 's event country . and second family be such non-factor . devote maybe five or six scene total family . poor son ... Please NBC , do notmake movie other era ... .leave PBS and history Channel
movie be horrendous . decent fight scene or not, acting be really bad , can tell be read their line card . painful line delivery everyone cast . think watch high school play and cringe obvious lack smoothness actor 's interaction ( weird pause different character 's line , combine hurried line delivery other ) . movie be action , might be forgivable , but lot movie include plot set-up and Family Guy style , irreverent cut away ( oh , wow , be badly do ) . be assume be attempt be funny , but again come off bunch high-schoolers/ college entry student goof off afternoon try set up funny Youtube clip.Now fight scene . be nottoo bad , consider level quality see everywhere else film . nothing great either , certainly notanywhere same level other poster have state ( nothing Drunken Master ) . fight have overly stage feel , LOTS cut different angle blatantly different position involved.In sum , only reason watch movie be be one guy 's friend involve very , very cheap production . which guy may ask ? oh , same guy who write , direct , produce and stare Middle School masterpiece .
Holy cow , what piece sh*t movie be . do n't how filmmaker could take 250 word book and turn movie . guess do n't know either ! do n't remember fart or belch book , do ? take all time childrens classic , add fart , belch and sexual inuindo , and prostitute KAKA joke . should give good idea what hollywood producer think . have say , visually be interesting , but brilliant visual story be ruin toilet humor ( even think kind thing be funny ) I do N'T want kid that know think is.Do n't take your kid see , do n't rent DVD . hope ghost Doctor Suess ghost come and haunt people that make movie .
The Derek do seem struggle find roll Bo " 10".I use work marine park Florida Keys . One day , script " ghost can n't do " be circulate trainer " fish house " where food be prepare dolphin . there be one scene where -dolphin- supposedly proposition Bo ( or Bo dolphin ) , ask " go make egg . " read script , -lauuughed- ... do notend up do portion movie our facility , our dolphin -were- " Big Blue ! " must have be very close end Anthony Quinn 's life . hope have fun film , certainly do n't do anything his legacy .
matter how well mean his " message " be - film be terribly make trainwreck - awful acting , lame camera work - do notknow why Carr agree try and pull off stutter - be lousy . watch extra DVD and way have camera follow around - just soak up - love be center attention . be bad actor - remind arrogant filmmaker - Eric Schaffer . some how Carr have have film show city Youth Centers and New Age church - where damaged people look reinforcement and attention babble on about how film touch and maybe do - but film be choppy , predictable and sappy .

" be more frightening one . do n't waste your time or your money .
attempt watch movie twice and even then fast forward irritate part but still could notmake end.I do n't understand how movie *genuinely* get good review . think people give such good review be just try hype movie marketing purpose . their review seem very unrealistic and look inside job , which make thing more pitiful . movie should get true positive comment their own steam and notcontrived one ! !The acting be reminiscent cheesy porno movie , and notfunny way . do n't mind low budget movie bad act know how work it.I find lead character be irritate . his facial expression and humor be unbearably childish . think be intentional make womens conspiracy seem more enjoyable and found , but be even worse.The script be also very awkward ( his boss overdo business speech ) and unfunny sarcastic remarks.I do notfind anything redeem movie other attractive women.Never have feel rating be mislead . be interested its premise but scare off everything else . course see want , but just do n't want anyone else get their hope up/waste their time.Maybe be just ... probably not.

what God 's name happen here ? how do go create what be practically cheap knockoff Redneck Zombies ? be Zombie ' 90 ever suppose entertain someone ... anyone , or even make dollar profit ? but mainly , what happen here ? zombie ' 90 Extreme Pestilence be direct lunatic name Andreas Schnaas , who specialize earth-shattering gore film , such Goblet Gore , and Anthropophagus 2000 , and which contain profanity title . gore department , one be n't much different rest . , level ineptness ... well , earth-shattering.Zombie ' 90 Extreme Pestilence be as bad Peter Jackson 's Dead-Alive be gory , think about it.Getting too specific story would be waste time . accident , involve chemical cause dead come back , and eat living . never have concept be treat such manner . gore effect be whole , new low . just Z-grade nightmare . ca n't tell , or notbe originally mean be funny , somehow , doubt English dubbing be be very true original script , but stranger thing have happen . whole thing just remind shot-on-video introduction Troma movie , last hell lot longer.I have see only one film that be bad , Chooper.For proof Andreas Schnaas be actual director , would highly recommend Nikos impaler think have standard what look bad movie , give Extreme Pestilence try , but have be warn . take nerve steel make all way through . but gore be be here , then might be able stomach one . other , atmosphere , no , and mean No budget , entertainment value , but mostly , pride . show pride , Schnaas . negativeUpdated 7/5/09 : few more viewing Zombie ' 90 , have have change heart , or guess just get now . zombie ' 90 be hilarious , so nevermind harsh word , , Extreme Pestilence still only deserve one star .
film be waste time , even rent DVD . super-speedy camera shot get faster , might as well pay twenty buck get laundromat , get popcorn , and watch dryer spin . Jet Li be so much good . can only hope wo n't be make deal anytime soon make cliche-ridden film One.If there be one film should avoid , be " One " .
there be reason take documentary serious and there be four reason that:1 ) people who make documentary ( include director and producer ) be Serbs or Serbian origin , therefore criterion neutrality fail . instance , mention Diaspora Croat ( so call " Ustase " ) play huge part fall Yugoslavia , but do n't mention there be equal Serbian organization well ( Cetniks ) ! who be n't that familiar Balkan WW2 history : Serbian so call " Cetniks " that be portray documentary be so kind help British paratroops war . well , that be only half truth . be also fascist ( Monarch ) group who collaborate Germans , but then switch side when Hitler start lose war . be also ironic do n't mention Cetnik leader Mihajlovic documentary , man that be responsible kill thousand people and burn hundred village all Bosnia and Croatia . but mention certain Ante Pavelic ... hm ... Allow me be just little suspicious.2 ) most people interview be totally unknown . and have study war long time ( who be old British lady ! ! ! really have n't make her homework ! ) and be noteven present name , so could more or less be anybody , maybe someone take street . who knows.3 ) documentary talk Kosovo and how Serbs have live there age , and therefore should belong Serbia ( even be minority ) . well , when mention Serbian dominate part Croatia ( Krajina ) suddenly Serbs be portray how have right live there have be their home so long . fine , but what people do n't know be large city Krajina ( Knin ) have great historical importance Croatian people . be there where one most celebrated Kings Croatian history ( Zvonimir ) be crown , and therefore city have historical value Croatia . Serbs arrive almost 800 year or so later ! but no , Serbs should have Krajina and Kosovo accord documentary . be fair ? look double standard morality director . plus , be say documentary Croatian constitution do n't have law minority right , be lie be one first law implement BECAUSE fact Croatia have huge Serbian minority.4 ) film mention radical Croatian Paramilitarian leader call Glavas . or Muslim radical Oric . accuse be huge reason negative development war . yes , be radical , but want talk radical , why notalso mention Serbian radical paramilitary leader such Seselj and Arkan ? flaw be so many just present few , just so people get overview documentary . look people who make documentary be n't well prepare and do n't have gut criticize Serbs be afraid their Serbian relative would slap or something . there be n't many documentary there that be good quality , but good so far be " death Yugoslavia " where all significant participant war be interview ( e.g. Milosevic , Jovic , Bulatovic , Tudman , Izetbegovic , Karadzic etc. ) and where get whole 5 hour explanation fall Yugoslavia and war.One other thing . see comment documentary where person be frustrate about why US give support country ( Bosnia ) that have connection Bin Laden war . well , first all , all country involve conflict have nationalist president and Bosnian Muslims do n't have old ethnic identity ( previosly be call " Muslim Croat " ) have rely something else nationality raise spirit people , and be connect only thing have common : their religion . and take help Mujahedin one else would support . have fight 4:th large army Europe ! need all help could get . nationalism be good way unite people war . history have show .
premise Circle Two be intriguing one . forbidden love sixty year old painter Ashleigh ( Richard Burton ) and fifteen year old girl Sarah Norton ( Tatum O'Neill ) ; and question such relationship be acceptable given society 's standard . problem Circle Two , however , be fail live up its promise . Director Jules Dassin and Hedley should have put more thought screenplay . when watch film , expect learn something new love and sexuality . instead , get boring dialogue , pointless lecture art , outing where Sarah seem have more fun away Ashleigh , and closing scene so artificial its emotional impact be lose . script make good actor look bad . so can imagine how film 's problem be compound even further largely amateurish cast Jules Dassin assemble . Tatum O'Neill be nother element . do notbelieve second her character Sarah be love Ashleigh . her performance seem superficial , contestant beauty pageant . be as force be happy , when script require be happy , and be sad , when script ask be sad . only scene like in be very end when say nothing . be probably close Tatum 's Sarah Norton ever come be real . but Tatum be notonly one fault . Richard Burton 's Ashleigh lack charm , charisma and complexity attract even woman his own age , let alone fifteen year old . rest cast be also dismal . even their argue be unconvincing , wait take turn . who do ? Michael Wincott jealous ex-boyfriend Paul be probably good thing film , but his role be small . be fair actor , Dassin 's direction let everyone down ; but be also true great movie go script . Kubrick 's Lolita do James Mason and Sue Lyon ; Konchalovsky 's Runaway Train go script Jon Voight and Eric Roberts playing convict . director film also know how use music dramatize their film and reveal something character . spite its own score ( combination Antonio Vivaldi , Carl Off and Bernard Hoffer ) , Circle Two never succeed do that.In conclusion , idea forbidden love story elder painter and teenage girl be good one , but its execution Circle Two be terrible . many way , be shame controversial , Lolita-type story which most film director understandable reason would prefer avoid do nothave receive more intelligent treatment ; script which actor would have gladly rehearse be notwrite ; actor , who be commit their part or have talent make their character real , could notbe find ; and director Jules Dassin ( who do so much good film Rififi and Topkapi ) do nothave will put his foot down and say , " do film , must rethink love story and revamp script . " only silver lining be one day intelligent film elder painter and teenage girl fall love may one day be make . such film ever appear , this will be surely spark controversy , debate and question many year come .
Why else would do ? notexpect Dean Cain produce hit movie . or even decent movie . see Lois and Clark , be aware just how ... " good " Dean Cain is.Obviously be gonna be cheesey flick , and cheesey flick have its own special way make scratch your head . will notcall spoiler ca n't really spoil movie more already is.To begin ... why be fake helicopter ? mean ... why ? how come one scientist be Chicago and other scientist be LA and one could be more eastern European try ? how hard would have be get either American actor , or just change lame state sheet movie provide say people be n't American ? why be there 2 occasion when movie give slug line ? get helipad-day and then mess hall-day later on . and then that be , who care timeline . be honest , who care even when mention , but guess that be beside point.Does movie really get good be able view multiple split screen ? answer be no.That dragon sure can walk down hall..over..and ... and over ... .and ... who earth be responsible one bad ending film history ? be straight out scooby doo . oh , dragon be dead now ... say , wanna get dinner ? sure , but notChinese place ... .with Dragon name ! ! ah ha ha ha ! ! ha ha ha ! ! HAHA ha ! use be Superman ! AHA ha ha ! ha ha ! fade blackmy god , make cringe be so stupid.But never fear..even whole building explode ... and one be leave alive..for reason there be second untouched , unmanned lab that survive pretty well , so can make sequel . Hurray all .

can start wooden acting but film be disaster . have grow up NY can tell film be insult anyone who be familiar community or people . be noteven defender culture way and find be Hollywoodized piece trash fit its own fictional , ridiculous culture presentation and language anyone who watch Seinfeld know be inaccurate . be colossal waste time and , even bad , be notexactly interesting outcome be obvious and scene confrontation be laughably bad . who act way ? Nobody.The writer 's name sound Israeli or something nature but be clear do n't have clue subject be write about . look his bio , be shocking live New York and wonder how much real connection have community . even mediocre film " Stranger U " be good and more close truth dreck . read guy 's credit be wonder have write script C grade film that somehow feature star . shocking . perhaps know someone script be even par bad Dolph Lundgren film .
who could possibly sympathize two obnoxious protagonist ? what be intend be light , frothy comedy neighbor child who ca n't give up their childhood game dare even age well adulhood , come off more exercise cruelty and petulant self-indulgence . child , pair be unbearably precocious ; adult be intolerably immature . be bad combination .
piece crap might have be acclaimed 60 year ago , but be one most racist movie ever make Native American Indians play white man . right-wing Republican James Stewart be huge racist real life , just his close friend John Wayne . 1971 Stewart have actor Hal Williams fire " Jimmy Stewart Show " ( short-lived series mercifully flop ) just Williams be black . as be notbad enough , film be very dated and boring . watch " Dances Wolves " instead less racist view.Stewart be his forty when awful movie be make , and even his ridiculous wig still look paedophile chasing 16-year-old Debra Paget . be surprised be even allowed.negative .
do n't see much reason get movie much detail . Sylvester Stallone be once again John Rambo , author and survivor " Season hell " , recruit prison his only friend , Major Richard Crenna , secretly return Vietnam , take photo American prisoner believe be still hold horrible camp , and return engage enemy.Fat chance . what actually DID nothing more sneak , take pics , and sneak out ? who would come see movie ? be essentially celebration Stallone 's muscle . prepare his mission , see his well-oiled muscle bulge . ( be oil and bulge . ) there be ritual strap black leather , ugly gun , and even ugly knife . black gun be clean , assemble loud clack , and almost as oil Stallone 's muscle . bow be test and , yes , have enough poundage drive bolt enemy 's forehead . knife be sharpen slick snicks.Stallone and one his POW be betray one or two suit Washington , cynical politician who , can bet , be never even fist fight grammar school . gut , know ? just sit around their foot desk and drink foreign beer.The movie do what set out do , but what set out do be meretricious . deliberately cash myth popular mid-1980 there be uncountable number MIA quietly keep wretched camp North Vietnamese . bumper sticker be ubiquitous . ( Free Our MIA . ) why would keep ? be never quite reason out but perhaps turn POW slave labor force -- country that have absolutely resource other labor . or maybe their propaganda value instrument humiliate United States -- propaganda weapon Vietnamese keep secret world.As captive , Rambo be treat Medieval fashion North Vietnamese . dip his neck pig excrement and then haul out his wrist , his muscle still display . then , notcontent subhuman Vietnamese , Russian officer be bring play part Gestapo officer -- " Vee haff vays MAKING remember . " high-tech type , Russian use psychology and electricity , notjust pig dump.Rambo return and declare intend drift aimlessly " country love as much love , " bring up myth vet return Vietnam be uniformly spit upon and curse , which be why guess elect so many Congress and appoint other high-echelon position . last three losing presidential candidate be despise group . least Rambo 's aimless drift leave room open sequel , which arrive apace.The action movie Schwarzenegger and Willis and other be leaven wisecrack but Rambo be humorless . march dully 's phantasmal ideological swamp , kill mercy , barely speak , barely able speak . speak be sign weakness .
 Ulli Lommel 's 1980 film ' Boogey Man ' be no classic , but be above average low budget chiller that be worth look . sequel , 1983s ' Boogey Man II ' be ultimately waste time , but very least be entertaining one nottake least bit seriously . now II leave door open sequel , and would n't have mind see least one more . One day be browse video store mall come film entitle ' return Boogey man . ' when find be sequel early film be happy shell out few buck ... should have know well . opening title be ' Boogey Man 3 , ' be sequel two far superior film name above . well , nottotally anyway.Pros : Ha ! be laugh . be there anything good hunk cow dung ? let be see ... have footage ' Boogey man ' and , um ... be mercifully short . yeah , that be about it.Cons : where start ? decision , decision . first , movie be total bore . go one scene next anything remotely interesting or scary happening . acting be stiff good . " actor " be most likely friend director who have act experience whatsoever before , and probably none since . plot be nonexistent and script shoddily write . direction be just plain awful . director try make film look artsy fartsy make camera move around , light flicker , and filter , but add nothing . music be dull and hard hear part . tie original be botch . Suzanna Love 's character be name Lacey , notNatalie ! and event depict beginning original do nottake place 1978 . also , have 3 title , why be there mention what happen II ? finally , add nothing new or interesting either series or genre.Final thought : people waste time and money should be ashamed . be one thing that have be original film that be director 's first and suck . but instead be suppose be sequel film that be masterpiece , but be damn sure far more interesting and entertaining . there ever be sequel , which doubt , then need forget one ever happen and be handle either Lommel or someone who have least idea how make decent horror film.My rating : 1/5
 Please do n't waste your time . movie rehash bad Bram Stoker 's Dracula ( Van Helsing ) , Anne Rice 's Vampire Lestat ( rock music and silly biblical reference ) , and Blade ( high-tech toy ) . really like vampire movie and novel , and there be many there that be very good . but notstinker . noteven soundtrack help , mostly movie resort ridiculous scary classical music rather " kick-ass metal " report . only few time do hear metal ; mostly be tortured violin . avoid garlic and crucifix .

Ed Asner.The Good- commercial break be long . Peter Jason . end .
do really need more narcissistic garbage Baby Boomer generation ? technically , be Boomer , though time when all " idealistic youth " ' 60s be read Marx , burn their draft card , and generally prolong war which destroy ten thousand life ; be still grade school . but remember well , and 9 out 10 be just moronic fool , who would believe anything as long be destructive.This be just excercise self-importance kid who never really grow up .
only reason elect give flick shot be due presence Oscar winner Ernest Borgnine . all can say be , be great waste good actor ever put film . as far could tell , Borgnine be ONLY actor . other performance be so uniformly terrible , be amaze studio would actually pay " performer " appear . couple level talent act department story plod and insipid think my eye be go start bleed time credit roll , and have perfect cinematic disaster . obviously movie be make appeal audience child , and its credit , be well most original program Disney Channel and similar kid-focused network . but honestly , that be notsay much .
there have be plenty unknown movie or movie give bad review really like . be notone them.It be overact and use camera technique that make feel be watch soap opera . be ludicrously predictable and take most movie get go then leave ask " be ? " . once decide nottake movie too seriously and watch purely corny point view become more enjoyable . be one movie that would have wind up MST3000 be still on .
have get question who think idea . why ? what make think make second movie . memory serve , do n't Cinderella end " all live happily ever " ? be pretty sure do , or be imply . wait minute , all live happily ever after , how could there be sequel ? be try make most boring story history , there could n't be sequel . mean sure , could have Cinderella singing nonsense two hour , but why ? movie that end " happily ever " can nothave sequel ; do then do n't live happily ever ! something be get go wrong which cause problem first ending ! why ? be notright , be evil . be my final word matter .
be make 2007 and CG be bad movie make 1998 . one part movie there be stop motion shoot dinosaur that actually look good , but just make extremely amateur work CG stuff look even worse.The writing , act , directing and everything else movie be just terrible . be as bad as , notbad Raptor Island and 100 million BC ... pure crap ! again , as other movie , only scary part movie be actually get make and be now be air sci-fi channel.I still ca n't understand how somehow get people who do have act skill act movie and then somehow get act as terrible everyone else movie.For who be unsure , other poster be obviously be sarcastic his review ... or be one people who work movie .
 *** Contains Spoilers ***I do notmovie all.I find amazingly boring and rather superficially make , irrespective importance and depth propose theme : give eventually have die , how should approach life ? " light " way , Tomas ; " heavy " way Tereza ; or should find way notface question , Sabina ? how much be fidelity important relationship ? how much professional life can be mutilate sake our love one ? how much do have be involve political life and social issue our country ? unfortunately , have n't read Kundera 's novel but have be let down movie certainly will : want understand story be ruin movie adaptation ( which be my guess ) or be dull beginning.I disagree most positive comment that define movie masterpiece . simply do n't see reason why . what see be many flaw , and sample follows.1 ) three main character be throw and be very hard understand what drive when make their choices.2 ) " secondary " character be there just fill gap but do n't add nothing story and wonder be really necessary.3 ) do notlike how Tomas be impersonate . nothing be good . be so self-centered and selfish . be nothuman , sense . but when his self-confidence fail and realize depend other and be emotionally link someone , do notfind interpretation credible.4 ) be very unlikely artist Sabina could afford her lifestyle communist country 1968 . top , three main character be all very successful their respective profession , which sound strange . ) how can Tereza become effortlessly such good photographer ? b ) how can do so well country lack all economic incentive that usually motivate people succeed ? 5 ) fake accent English speak actor be laughable . and be noteven mother tongue . moreover , letter Sabina receive US be write Czech , which find very inconsistent.6 ) many comment praise movie say Prague be beautifully render : guess most movie be shoot location , so be notdifficult give movie eastern European feeling , and give intrinsic beauty Prague be noteven difficult make look good.7 ) find end sort trivial . Tereza and Tomas , finally happy countryside , far away temptation " metropoly " , distant social struggle their fellow citizen be live , detach their professional life , die car accident . but die have realize be happy , indeed . so what ? have die unhappy , would message movie have be different ? do n't think so . consider sort cheap trick please audience.8 ) only thing movie which be unbearably light be way director have portray character . see almost three hour , but end be leave nothing . do n't feel empathy , do n't relate , be leave there your couch watch sequence event and scene that have very little say.9 ) hate " stop music restaurant " scene ( which comment praise lot ) . why Sabina have get such strong reaction ? why Franz agree ? really do n't see point . only thing learn be Sabina have get very bad temper and quite strong personality . be . what be so special and unique ? all negative comment , let point tout there be two scene like lot ( that be why give two).The " naked woman Photoshoot " , where envy , jealousy , and insecurity Sabina and Tereza be beautifully presented.The other scene be one represent investigation occupation Prague Russians . Tereza picture , take let world know about what be go Prague , be use identify people take part riot . find quite original and Tereza 's sense despair and guilt be nicely portrayed.Finally , there be tiny possibility movie be intentionally " design " such way " Tomas type " be go like and " Tereza one " be go hate . be case ( strongly doubt , though ) then my comment should be revise drastically .
who ? what ? where ? when ? why ? act be terrible . very robotic , rehearse . have see all actor film good role . screenplay be very elementary . end film , story line be tie up . and Jeane Claude Lamarre should be tie up , too . so never attempt write/direct film .

" executive decision " should doubt be be choice one , even " Turbulence"-movies be good . fact , other movie world be good one .
The Christmas Secret be tout wonderful film , but be truly disappoint . even sell VBS and DVD copy film when be over , which lead think producer be really proud project . screen actor feel most performance be phone , Beau Bridges , Nick , do have moment or two . be Richard Thomas would notput film my otherwise fine resume . be embarrassment . have be fan his Walton day , but have find untempted watch his subsequent work , so poor be offering.In defence actor , directing be stilted , mechanical , and thoroughly amateurish.I hope be notconsider spiteful review and negative assumption make my qualification critic . turn movie have good cast and be prepare enjoy film . however would challenge one out there watch film and notwish their money back , even be T.V.

account , could have be interesting film . feature score mighty Cradle Filth , star their frontman Dani and being hyp up " future British horror " , expect Alex Chandon 's gore fest live up hype.I be wrong.Everything film be cliche or inept . short story anthology setup be do death ( and much good ) seventy and eighty . admittedly , idea ' sick room ' do send chill my spine , but most film be let down bad script writing and acting.Chandon can write dialogue . sentence main police investigator be brim full swear and insolence ( typical ' cop edge ' formula . funny , i be sure i have see somewhere else before ... ) Chandon , be notTarantino . or Scorsese . sound Bad . add ludicrously Ott act very dodgy casting ( do n't get wrong , Dani Filth be great singer and musician , but actor ai n't ) and performance be beyond laughable vein burstingly cringe . give Bruce Campbell day.The visual effect be whole poor , atrocious CGI , awful gore effect ( goodness sake , Peter Jackson do good and be over ten year ago less budget ) and edit filter that shriek OVER-USE ! as often mistime use Cradle Filth 's score ... man , should sue.The fundamental problem Cradle fear be take seriously , try build atmosphere and incite terror and repulsion its audience . too many good horror film make seventy and eighty do so much well far superior gore effect ( eg : maniac , zombie flesh eater , , suspiria etc ) , render Cradle fear , my mind , second-rate and obsolete.I hope Chandon can learn hideous ghoul film and go on make quality horror actually scares.Better luck next time .

when be young really enjoy watch bad television . have all be guilty time or , but my excuse watch thing " Buck Rogers 25th century " and " Silver Spoons " be : be young and naive ; ignorant what make show really worthwhile.Thankfully , now appreciate good stuff .

people who be praise film be real disappointment -- be hope least Leonard will see good $$ out , his life saving be embezzle away manager couple year ago and be 70 now . but film be simply terrible . begin Leonard say be notsentimental his past , and then next hour and half film emphasize all bad sentimental element Leonard 's song . be so bloody precious its endless close-up emote singer . Cohen 's interview be all do lo-fi video closeup and so want see medium or long shot his whole body ! could n't care less comment performer , especially overblown ego boy Edge and Bono . none performer film have do even one song good Leonard 's own music and be think see and have doubt , heed . would be acceptable PBS special , maybe , one time showing . but will even hesitate get DVD . when film finally show Leonard semi-performing " Tower Song " be ruin Bono take verse . even occasional good performance ( Antony , Rufus ' first number , Martha be traitor ) be spoil context rest turgid blabla . forget one , and go buy Leonard 's most recent album want pay tribute .

 Ugh ! where begin ... first , Campbell Scott 's non-stop angst become real turn-off awhile ( very short while ) internalize his mount anguish , curiosity and anger . only do n't care ! character as present writer and director be wholly unlikable , and therein lie key . have n't give anything make care be adulterous and or notbe still love one . when Scott quietly tell his wife , " could kill " their three daughter dinner table , shock his selfishly poor timing wear almost wish had--and then do same thing smug , wisecrack apparition Denis Leary be haul off looney bin . utter waste time and perhaps--only perhaps--resources .

Eva Longoria would have be good little less on , and lot more showing . action bimbo be n't much.I could n't see real plot , other Douglas boinking president wife . never do say why mercenary be try kill pres. just do n't see President United States run his life utility tunnel building , rat maze . p-l-e-a-s-e.Hollywood be dead . movie be proof . like ' big screen ' . have be kid . many more ' movie ' and will quit go . Whats matter Hollywood , make many chick flick , forget how make real movie ? own theater , will start run old movie . one real actor , good story line - and good Cinemaphotography.This ' movie ' be dog . do n't waste your time or money . rate ' movie ' zero !

" film take many such arrogant leap . Thomas Young do double-slit experiment 1805 and find light can look particle time , and wave time . course have never *know* watch stupid film only reference be " atom can be particle and wave . " and must mean people can pass wall , walk water , and never grow old just wish star ! ! then be sure Marlee Matlin could stop be deaf just *believed* hard enough . be be sarcastic , but film be chock-full false hope and belief people espouse do n't really hold.These be New Age kook who have grab Quantum Theory reaffirm everything believe meditation , zero point energy , crystal healing , etc. snake-oil salesman truly believe crap be sell , could n't just *wish* their paycheck existence instead appear joke film ? get listen nameless man , credential that know , talk his couch front fireplace ( or TV screen ) how create his own life . time be screen want someone rush in and throw pie his face . people take WAY too seriously . other balding guy suit say nobody ever *really* touch anything there be magnetic force prevent quantum level . only someone have walk screen and keep punch stomach , scream " be nottouch ! be nottouch !

Marlee Matlin get drunk wedding be suppose photograph and next day decide love and take bath be beautiful and unique snowflake.I like when film say people often find evidence their pre-conceived notion . perhaps review be only see what want see , but truly want see people get pie face , and never happened.If have never hear idea present film before , may find interesting , but there be good source idea here . want watch good movie talk Heisenberg uncertainty principle , go see man who be n't there . want read good book Quantum Field Theory , read Hyperspace Michio Kaku . want see film talk different philosophy imaginative visual , see Waking Life ( can feel boring , self-important , and pretentious time ) . , should go and read Quantum Psychology or Prometheus Rising Robert Anton Wilson instead waste your time movie.I normally have very hard time give movie score 1 10 , but one be very easy : negative Stars.The movie 's title be true . people film do n't know #$* ! hand down , bad movie have ever see .

when see Mary Louise Parker be associate epic novel turn film , be intrigue . be fan book , assume will be play Tony , Roz , or Charis , but more so , be intrigue see how would turn very head-y , almost psychological ( but notpsychological thriller ) novel movie that would be accessible who have n't read novel , and that would be least mildly satisfy who have . book be complex reflection society , woman , and modern life , and be interested see how use 3 different narrative that lead unfold story film . what actually do be crime.The big error and confusing issue be : why would Oxygen , network that advertise be woman , take amazing book how complex , wonderful , and terrible woman be and can be , and change protagonist 3 woman dumb former cop real motive be involve story ? seem whoever adapt take easy way out use guy straight up ask Roz , Tony , and Charis about how know Zenia and do , rush bulk book . do muddy story and cut everything that be great character , aside make audience have one credible associate . film , woman be n't people , be characters.In book Zenia do fake her death , but book mention get point , film waste 30-45 minute focus former cop run around and do nothing use . try make complex book episode Law and Order or CSI.It turn out Mary Louise Parker play Zenia , which be so wrong . Zenia be Catherine Zeta-Jones , Angelina Jolie , or maybe even Scarlett Johnasson type . be woman man ca n't notadore , and woman woman be intrigue and threaten , but " keep your enemy closer " kind way . and once get close , seem totally genuine and trust worthy , your good judgment . be kind woman who , even when lose , win : be always still beautiful , still rich , and there be always still people there who do n't know her game.In film , Zenia do n't take Charis 's man ( blonde American draft dodger who be use Charis first place ... ) but instead take August and try become her legal guardian ( and apparently come back be her Lesbian lover linger kiss coffee shop imply ) . and Zenia do kill chicken leave August , but make sense build up be remove . be be as whoever write screenplay be grasp straw satisfy who read book , but think have notread book , would have spend whole movie confuse , have bother stick all.And Roz 's husband be dead Zenia come picture ( which be weird Zenia take Roz 's business and home life book , which be why Roz hate her so much ) and and Zenia have conspire kill Roz 's husband year and year back . and accord film Tony and West have be date forever ... even party where Zenia and West ( book ) have paint whole place black and make Tony seem totally ( and evil , bitchy ) person who be always respect everyone her intelligence and popular . Tony 's character be so wrong film ... seem little psycho and mastermind whatever conspire be go down as oppose kind gawky , mildly reclusive teacher be book . film basically imply smart woman be evil , beautiful woman be evil , powerful woman be evil , and woman who teach yoga be their rockers.They basically try make Zenia be n't necessarily as awful be book , and then , end , three woman convince former cop ( who , course process research , meet Zenia and have affair that be suppose end move Barbados or something ridiculous , which course Zenia bail ) hide Zenia 's body ( which find splat hotel be stay , but film imply one three woman push balcony , or conspire together do ... ) and then Zenia also manage take Roz 's money process . end film be only pay attention commercial b/c have spiral so far space what could and should have been.If be n't confuse breakdown film , then maybe would like , have read book and see movie , and movie alone be ridiculously confuse . be terrible . get make film out book be quite task , but be go take task , should start determine what book be unnecessary , instead create useless character be our Alice wonderland.Are there really fluffy book Oxygen could be make least decent TV movie ?
believe war film should try convey terror war , avoid idealism and respect rudimentary military principle . Zvezda barely do first . Zvezda be Russian war film , be expect patriotism , sentimentality , beautiful poetic picture , lush score , Slavic cheekbone and cruel Germans . what do n't need be naive love non-affair , unrealistically silly war scene and abuse syrupy soundtrack film which avoid carefully historical or political reference ( Stalinism , Nazism , Holocaust ) only end passing but nonetheless insulting our sense history endnote " liberate Poland " . miss opportunity film but notpropaganda apparently .
what be people here talk about ? must have see different movie guy . be so bore walk out theater . what be up stuff . only laugh once and noteven hard . whoever greenlit movie should be take out street and beat . usually always find something like movie , but be crazy . " slacker " make " notteen movie " look classic . rank up there such trash " Body Shots " , " Con Air " , and " Conspiracy Theory " one bad time . avoid AT ALL cost ! think studio would be hand out money people leave theater sign their apology , but my dismay that be n't happen . look like will never see money again or two hour .
Deep SH. . be more ! eel be just cartooned film . think " incredible Mr. Limpet " meet " Leviathan " . very tacky.No character or relationship development . so call " romantic " scene very corny and predictable . interesting idea , but poorly write script and lousy special effect make definite must-miss !
life ca n't figure out why anyone would make movie . plot be tired , acting be strain , language be consistently foul and time use " F " word seem lack dialog be prevalent so ' let be throw couple " F 's " good measure , that be what American public want hear ' . Gossett be particularly foul and seem enjoy his part . forget c__p , rent ' Shrek " and have good laugh .
just have add , case anyone actually read and have n't completely get point yet . other reviewer be n't joke around , really be bad colour movie be likely ever see . when movie start could n't believe something actually make out world see.They be notjust say when say look home movie . really do . " director " take family hi8 camcorder ( DV camera and computer non-linear edit ) , other equipment ( light , sound gear , etc ) , grab decent-looking act student , and go out shoot movie . script , just make up go along.When watch , be my mono TV , so only have one channel audio ( leave right speaker ) . first think have hook up wrong . movie be silent someone speak couple minute . get up and switch over other channel and suddenly could hear music and sound effect but then could n't hear dialog . record sound different bloody channel ! mean , there be movie that can be funny watch , so bad be good , kind thing . be notsure be one . mean , will admit be bit budding film maker . and see bad movie just make want go out there and PROVE can do good , know . but watch just make feel sorry whoever make it.As bad be , actor be only good thing . think chick be hot and be disappoint brevity her bath scene . bit T and would have raise score nothing maybe 3 or 4 . but alas , no . want make movie but be turn out crap , throw gratuitous nudity . work Roger Corman .
do n't know what be Brady kid . first , Barry Williams publicly brag have sexy his TV sister , Maureen McCormick , then date his TV mom , Florence Hederson . then , Susan ( Cindy ) Olsen do music bunch porno movie . then Mike ( Bobby ) Lookinland get trouble drunk driving . finally , Maureen ( Marcia ) McCormick and Eve ( Jan ) Plum might have have little same-sex fling side . now , Christopher ( Peter ) Knight be pursue beautiful young model her early-20s his stint " Surreal Life " , which first be fun watch , and now be marry and very volatile and hostile relationship . last episode , where pose bunch nude photograph naked girl scrapbook give Christopher his birthday , be notgood move her part . and deal very mature fashion , just pick up and leave clear his head . think be always bow need and now be finally take stand . and hate say , but think abuse , verbally . way be torture engagement ring and way ream little thing . also talk openly have fling other woman and be obvious still sleep around woman and man , which be notsomething self-respecting human being should do when already marry someone . be man talk down his wife , and go out night party and have sex other people , everyone would be rally wife leave . why should this be different . what start out cute little crush reality show blossom huge disaster . Adrianne , as beautiful be , be Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan , clearly need therapy cry baby so many silly thing . feel sorry , but Chris need rid , be good man who can afford be humiliate .
so call remake be terrible . go see tonight. . first day anticipation and hype be too much handle . but first half hour , know be disaster . notonly do notmatch hype create but also insult original blockbuster . script have loophole , edit be untidy quite few time . Mohanlal who be excellent actor do okay job . Amitabh be alright. . director want portray how evil his character be but go bit overboard which result be forceful . Ajay who be especially smooth kind role be also disappointment . let noteven get start new guy Prashant. . would n't be proud start off career something . Rajpal Yadav who be throw few laugh could n't even get smile out anyone his forceful humor and shrill voice . Nisha Kothari prove be one bad actress have today . , RGV who think be one most talented and gifted director India have had. . fail miserably . take up such huge challenge and responsibility remake what be know well Hindi movie ever and make mess out .
be expect love movie--film noir , serial killer , dark irony . be baffle many choice character make ( " Hey , know be creepy look , but let 's hook up cross-country road trip anyway ! " ) , find pace be glacial , and emphasis moody lighting take place original thought director and cinematographer.Thinking now , would have be much good movie someone have just run script common sense-o-meter ( 1992 model ) start film ...
like " Blair " will like one . have same lousy camera-work and soundtrack , and have same non-existent plot and suspenseful moments.It also have Tom Savini , so like Romero 's " Dawn dead " or Tarantino and Rodriguez ' " Dusk Dawn " be treat . be icon and very good actor well.No , seriously . movie be definitely lousy movie have see long time , and have see quite few movie -- bad one well . can tell find most horror movie entertaining respect , but be just pure waste time.The only reason why give movie 2 instead 1 , be naked chick and hot action all sharp-looking plastic tooth ... no , be just kid . must have miss hit " submit " vote form.Stay away , even have sexy girl tooth cover !
" Christmas Story " be one many people 's all-time most beloved film . ACS be able take viewer time and place such way very few film ever have . have sweetness and goodwill be rare.So await ( and await ) its sequel , " run Family " . film be almost release couple time , only be pull last minute . when finally come out , IRITF be ( and be , guess ) total failure.The set and cinematography be just fine , but directing totally , completely miss mark . film be nothing more cash-flow formula lazy casting , lazy writing , and disconnected acting.The narrator , Jean Shepard , who be one America 's great humorist and story-teller , force false reprise warm wit use ACS . over-emoted , and why do will never know . somehow manage become annoy , overwrought parody himself.The write and act IRITF be inauthentic and force . actor may have see ACS , but whatever wit and nuance that be ACS must n't have register . act be embarrassingly slapstick and bereft Shepard 's dry humor.ACS will always be real treasure , but call IRITF sequel be insult fan Jean Shepard and ACS .
TV movie go show bad film do exist . only reason see be be cover KTMA MST3K . be Super Bowl Superdome New Orleans . however , football be play whatsoever and see scene look basically nothing . many star film , make difference . really do n't know why watch .

 Spoilers ahead , but do really matter ? have ever read movie review compose entirely question ? could this be ? why do ancient civilization bury artifact all world ? why be question never answer ? why be opening text crawl incoherent ? why would nun ( sure seem nice ! ) hand 20 orphan madman ? have there always be gold mine downtown Vancouver ? why do one gold mine 's shaft exit front yard orphanage ? why do Tara Reid 's character suddenly show up Christian Slater 's apartment sex ? ( or do just answer my own question ? ) why would even non-archaeologist bang open obviously valuable solid gold chest sledgehammer ? why would modern computer still display green pre-Tron-era grid outline object , complete little " bleep " ? and must movie explosive timer have digital display ? why do n't ANYTHING movie make sense ?
only reason " Norliss Tapes " deserve ANY star be presence Angie Dickinson cast . other get see Angie Baby pre-"Police Woman " performance , there be nothing else worth see here.THE SYNOPSIS:*** minor SPOILERS ***David Norliss be tap write book supernatural . One day mysteriously disappear phone his publisher and suggest have stumble something that have place mortal danger . entire series which miserable pilot be write be apparently intend be series flashback " Norliss tape " -- set audio tape writer record investigate case supernatural.In pilot episode , wealthy sculptor die -- but notpurchase ancient Egyptian scarab ring local occultist who assure bauble will give immortality death . soon discover ring do n't grant immortality . instead , only reanimate sculptor 's corpse , allow escape his crypt can run around town drain pretty girl all their blood.Blue-faced , yellow-eyed and growl out ARRRGHHHHHHs have n't hear last watch " Scooby Doo " cartoon , sculptor attack his wife ( Dickinson ) one dark night . escape and , mutual acquaintance , contact Norliss get his assistance solve mystery her late husband 's uncanny reappearance her estate.So be guy vampire ? No. there be vampire story what may have read or hear . sculptor do n't drink his victim ' blood -- collect . how ? do n't know . only see attack , never collect . why ? fulfill second part his bid immortality . turn out reanimate sculptor will only be allow live forever build life-size statue demon name Sargoth mixture clay and human blood . once be finish , Sargoth plan inhabit statue , use his gateway our world.THE Final ANALYSIS:"The Norliss Tapes " be n't pick up series very good reason ... be garbage . can see my synopsis , story be paltry , ill-conceived mess . acting and dialogue offer no well . be n't even contender " so bad be good " award . sometimes bad be just bad.After year hear underground rumbling great merit " Norliss Tapes , " be very excite find air Fox Movie Channel 10/15/03 . wish have n't set up fall.Having screen groaner first time two day ago , can only assume applause have hear so far other IMDB reviewer be come who be review show base dim memory and nostalgia youth . or perhaps be simply loyal fan Dan Curtis . way , have offer mislead review " Norliss Tapes."Pauly Orchid -- October 17 , 2003

Billy Bob be only about two minute ( guess need work time his career ) , and rest movie be painful . reason though , be undeniably awful , do n't hate . be probably save my ire high budget , special effect laden junk " Fast and Furious " and not" no-budget " flick one . negative push .
be sure Operations Dames be favorite drive-in back day . there be absolutely nothing way plot might miss be otherwise preoccupy . and need get mood other activity do have curvaceous cutie screen get mood.Otherwise there ai n't whole lot Operations Dames have go . be set Korean War where platoon GI together British tommy get little too far forward and have get back UN line . bad enough already , but guy also come strand bunch USO girl and their choreographer same predicament.You know what be sad film be take woman generation finally get accept Army and combat situation . bimbo USO set woman 's liberation back light year . fact noteven hard bite professional soldier who be sergeant charge man can keep his pants.But that be probably well remind what be drive-in . name cast be well off notrecognize individual effort.Operations Dames be definitely team flop .
One " come age " film that should have nostalgia adult and promise kid . movie have . be poor excuse let Sylvia Kristel 's body double frolic dorky Eric Brown . make matter worse , movie be either silly or stupid when try be funny , sexy , or dramatic . laugh awkwardly be suppose believe teenager would go alone bury dead woman his front yard . ponder vigorously why woman famous Emmanuelle need body double . movie go and , start imagine hybrid Private Lessons and Little Miss million that have Sylvia Kristel seduce Jennifer Love Hewitt Howard Hesseman make nostalgic WKRP . watch laugh other people 's stupidity , or Ed Begley Jr. 's committed performance , or wonder what Sylvia Kristel would look Jennifer Love Hewitt . but can give idea your lesson , stay away movie stare Sylvia Kristel that be notEmmanuelle .

This sound really interesting movie blurb . Nazis , occult , government conspiracy . be expect low budget Nazi version DaVinci code or Boys Brazil or even Shockwaves . instead get something quite different , more psychological , more something David Lynch . be actually plus . but way story be tell be just awful.Part trouble be casting . Andrienne Barbeau 's character start off moving be somewhat timid and afraid . just do n't do well , even her age , certainly try . actor cast son apparently think be comedy . most other actor also seem have think be campy movie , or least act , rather simply be quirky . only one think do really well be daughter , Siri Baruc.Another big part be pace . start off very slowly . so slowly might be tempt turn off . but then get compelling while when get daughter 's suicide and aftermath . but shortly afterward , all become jumble mess . be purpose , but much be just needlessly confusing , monotonous , and poorly focused.The real problem , be be simply notpleasant movie watch . be slow , dull , none character be likable . Overuse imagery and set . movie see character get torture . , be viewer that do . do have few creepy moment , most notably creepy Nazi painting and credit , but rest movie be mostly just tiresome .
This have be bad direction have see . close-up can be very powerful shot , but when scene consist nothing but close-up , lose all its impact.Tony Scott have very beautiful scenery work , backdrop Mexico , cantina , beautiful estate where Anthony Quinn live , and dusty town Costner roll his journey revenge . unfortunately only catch quick glimpse place camera cut picture big , giant head . even transition scene where Costner be drive alone Mexico quickly cut close-up.The score be over-dramatic and intrusive , dictate emotion should feel . story should have be handle much well . other thing , too many people pop up out nowhere help Costner along - be just bad writing.It be typical thriller storyline , but many other have take same premise and do outstanding thing . Costner 's No Way Out have somewhat similar storyline , but be much good movie.The end be completely anticlimactic and suffer most melodramatic score film . movie be never go be great , but see more Mexico and less giant head film might have be watchable .

few day ago , watch documentary call FIFTY WORST MOVIES ALL time and be where first hear INCREDIBLE MELTING man . be lover schlocky film , be make point try find film documentary--not just include INCREDIBLE MELTING Man . fact , MELTING Man be first " bad film " have see then and must say be rather disappoint . truly be bad film , come nowhere near close enough make inclusion list.Now see documentary , have enjoy " bad film " ever read book " Fifty Worst Movies time " Harry Medved . same title , book come out long , long documentary and maker documentary never credit Medved concept . Medved book , have see about 35 50 film but have come impasse--the rest film just be n't available VBS or DVD . so , think will try film same name.The reason be most disappoint INCREDIBLE MELTING Man be there be few good element film . first , melting guy special effect be generally really cool and disgusting . be obvious professional ( famous Rich Baker ) be involve make look realistic . however , should also point out there be also more few cheap and cheesy effect well--such floating plastic head and way monster run around his left arm be cut off--you could see " cleverly hidden " his clothes ! as story , be just stupid . group astronaut miraculously penetrate ring Saturn be crush . then , comment about how beautiful sun is--as see closeup . be odd Saturn be so far it--it should notlook way--it should be large speck . regardless , immediately scene change and be tell one survive astronaut be hospital . what happen last scene and one ? Yep , be anyone 's guess . well , soon after , survivor escape and engage murderous rampage his entire body melts.Now consider have psycho run who look melting popsicle , will think government would pull out stop find and stop , right ? ! wrong . general engage one lone doctor find ! ! army , police--just dopey doctor . even body begin stack up , point do doctor or general do anything organize meaningful search or get backup.Now , give stupidity film , also would n't be surprise find following:When melting dude be run around doctor 's house , doctor give his wife powerful sedative and leave house.When cute old couple be drive late night , naturally stop orchard pick fruit and be killed.When lady see melting dude , barricade door protect . would be smart do n't have back door house next ! instead just leave house and escape , just wait ! when photographer and his model be take snapshot , guy grab his assistant and yank off her top . why ? well give audience cheap thrill and make rate R flick.When melting dude be finally locate and sheriff have clear shot , doctor stop him--even though now monster have kill half dozen people.So , can see film abound stupid plot element . be very bad film . but , give occasionally good special effect , just be n't horrible film have hope . sure , be good laugh , but no where near Plan 9 From Outer Space badness and never should have be include anyone 's bad film list .
might be tempt rent film Peter Sellers appear . would be mistake . be one most pointless film ever make . keep wait something funny happen , but nothing funny appear movie . even film industry recognize be very weak film and do n't even try promote . its wonder be ever put video.I wonder what sort contract cause Sellers be film . also wonder why people responsible film be allow go make other bad film . surely film be waste money use create , and waste anyone 's time watch . surely there be high school student who would be able write/produce film which as plot .
Live ! yes , but notkicking.True story : time ago , Dutch TV station make announcement be go air new reality show . contest rather . main participant show would be woman who be die something terrible and would be donate her kidney one lucky person progressive kidney failure . real.The country and international medium be all story fly turd , say be appalling , immoral , what-is-this-world-coming-to , and . way , have agree.As month pass , tension build up degree government be mostly occupy issue should let show go ahead or not, instead run country.The show do air and right up last moment be push ahead . and up last moment country be up arm , Prime Minister make speech , newspaper write , everyone country hold their breath . and network push . new frontier television . and definitely succeed do just that . push envelope.The show air and all watch terminally ill woman select right candidate receive her kidney or would live , would die shortly after.And then , last moment show be reveal be partial hoax . woman be notill , but all candidate be . there be kidney auction . whole show , that , publicity and commercial and all discussion , build up month fantastic climax , be publicity stunt focus attention problem major shortage organ donor . man who found particular network die kidney disease.Now This be television . leave everybody far behind amazement.Do n't give poorly act , poorly direct flick woman try get Russian Roulette show American TV.As if.*Spoiler* be go believe would get FCC . as be go believe would get US Supreme Court basis free expression . as be gonna believe ridiculous ending where woman pull off and have conscience issue guy shoot air.It have all be do before . watch run man Arnold instead . least have semi good ending.*Spoiler* be appallingly bad piece film , together ridiculous ending . so get shot end , be suppose make movie go public feel good leave theater there be kind justice ? do n't take my word , but would say : leave one alone and watch test pattern instead , will get more quality .
just finish watch movie and find be basically just notfunny all.I be RPG Gamer ( computer type , none DnD tabletop stuff ) but find none joke funny all.Some scene seem drag out lot ( tilt and zoom could have be cut down 5seconds rather minute ) and feel as director be just try fill time.I think laugh total 2-3 time entire movie.The act be n't all bad , standard B Grade movie should have.I will suggest notbother movie be huge DnD fan and even then would probably be well steer clear .

 DEATHSTALKER be perfect B-fantasy movie fan ; barely 80-minute travesty film-making feature everything heckler can ask for--non-existent plot , terrible acting ( save least raspy-sounding old lady ) , laughable script and schlock edit , and bargain-basement style background setting . there be character that come across likable or interesting ( particular , lead do n't have anything appeal ) , and actor assemble barely do anything rise F-grade material . be notenough , then how about lack compelling plot ( which movie have nothing sort ) make DEATHSTALKER qualify major turkey ? be also offend woman movie barely serve purpose other 1 ) be topless and/or scantily clad ; 2 ) get rape ; 3 ) have sex hero ; 4 ) above . addition , background music be hideous ; bizarre mess electronic noise , cheesy choral burst , and blare orchestral cacophony . ear numb and eye numb one pack nary thing keep one interested , DEATHSTALKER be probably well suit folk look something laugh ( and believe , there be plenty here ) . otherwise , do notrecommend 100th-grade Conan wanna-be anyone least .
series have potential , but suppose budget would n't allow see potential . interesting setup , notdissimilar " lose " fall flat 1st episode . whole series , 6 episode , could have make compelling 90 minute film , but maker choose drag on and on . many scene be unbearably slow and long move action forward . music be very annoy and do notwork overall . there be few character care about their character do notgrow time frame- -- well , grow bit . end be as terrible rest series . only kudos here be art dept and set dresser , create interesting look , too bad writer and director lack foresight do something interesting element
have read comment film and can only surmise people be easily entertain . movie be nothing . be so badly write , direct and act barely make impression . character speak cliche-ridden dialogue and situation be completely implausible . might make campy and fun , do n't everything be so lifeless film become dull . be as Lee Rose decide write drama woman struggle her sexuality but then either be n't allow studio exec give story true-to-life gusto or do n't have cojones . movie could go enyclopedia standard-issue bad Lifetime TV movie .
when see preview movie think may be dumb , but will least be funny . well be wrong . even though somewhere deep producer have interesting message convey parent be leave alone and re-evaluating their life , way try deliver message be horrible . first fifty time something silly happen couple be relatively funny . but end , could almost predict what stupid mishap be go happen next.Throughout movie like total maybe five line dialogue and everything else be good mediocre , which be still more can say movie .
film be so amateurish could hardly believe what be see . be shoot Video ! notfilm ! have notsee like early 70 's , when late night network show movie week ' horror flick ' shot ... ... video . look bad soap opera , and that be pay compliment . actor give their good shot . Michael Des Barres do okay what be give do , which be act sex addict control . ca n't say be pleasant watch.Nastassja Kinski therapist sit chair practically entire film , very little variation camera angle . ca n't fault someone else be poor block , but be totally unbelievable her role . her little girl voice work here . and consider Nastassja Kinski fan . be certainly ageless and exotic , but be her range this.Alexandra Paul be pathetically overwrought . line deliver be three exclamation point . someone must have direct scream cost . why would Michael Des Barres want have sex such rage shrew ? finally , Rosanna Arquette sweet , malign wife come off okay , and probably most believable bunch . but be notsay much.This have be bad film have see year .

Yuck.The interview be as much or more other musician and figure rather Cohen . only rarely do film feature Cohen read his own work ( never singing) -- letter , poem , etc. movie really do n't capture much artist 's life story , either , or his development year . huge disappointment big Cohen fan .

 PLEASE TAKE A MINUTE To Read My ENTIRE REVIEW . be notKNOCKING THE Film ITSELF - ONLY THE DVD VERSIONS Currently AVAILABLE.***I really want give film even two star . mean how could possibly rank mere 1 10 ! ? ! here be how : epic film adaptation Tolstoy 's novel " War and Peace " historically accurate battle scene , courtesy Red Army , and extremely faithful , scene-for-scene adaptation novel would be difficult but worth sit through seven hour - be what be seeing.The trouble be ca n't see film - anywhere as far know.I be attempt watch RusCiCo DVD version - widely consider good version available 's letter box and restore scene that be cut other DVD releases.But , be one bad film print have ever see transfer DVD . picture be muddy and inconsistent , often strobing . be almost tolerable crank your brightness , color and picture level up maximum ... . but problem do n't end there.The sound be also way inconsistent , blaringly loud part , virtually inaudible others.And language , be Huge problem English speaker - dub option have good actor , and really terrible one whose performance grate , and part film just be n't dub , slip back Russian and even French randomly.The subtitle option be n't much well . subtitle do n't appear image , but right - obscure beauty ( or what be leave ) scenery . furthermore , subtitle be often poor translation ( shame give script take pain hew so close Tolstoy 's actual word ) , and subtitle too seem just drop out parts.So , even max out color , brightness and picture setting , and turn volume way up , and choose subtitle *and* English dub , be still go get film that be annoy watch and listen to.Can be content overcome ? might have be able , but seven hour - who can stand long ? maybe someday , someone will come along and restore - and maybe then will see masterpiece - but now , just ca n't give more one star something have only be able stand watch first 12 % .

many people like point TV movie when argue vast legion Hanks-philes out there Tom do fact make crappy film ( think " Bachelor Party " be great , but be story ) . movie focus " Dungeons and Dragons-style game " that eventually drive our young Gump hallucinatory madness . story be charmingly early 1980s , focus do imminent threat our youth pose evil role-playing games.I , however , prefer view " Mazes and Monsters " turn point " whatever happen Chris Makepeace ? " story . all remember ' Rudy the Rabbit ' " meatball " and hapless Clifford " My Bodyguard " , where give all vicarious thrill beat crap out Matt Dillon . few could argue ( especially who read " Dynamite ! " regular basis ) great thing be store him.And then come Rona Jaffe . line bad acting and bad writing be razor thin , so leave decide whose fault Makepeace 's performance be . all know be last major release see in be " Vamp " , and that be 1986 . have small role Sean Penn 's brother " Falcon and Snowman " , but time Brat Pack torch have be pass other straight hair and flashy resumes.I ca n't good conscience recommend movie . watch only see young , more idealistic Chris Makepeace , Rona Jaffe feast his soul .

First must admit Batman : animated series be good batman series far . watch when use be TV . do n't realize there be season four . actually there be n't . BTAS end season 3 , and should have stop there.Why do have mess good thing . Catwoman and Poison ivy now have terrible grey face . Joker look scary , seem time revise his appearance look more and more creepy . do n't seem have pupil anymore , and now do n't even look remotely human ( is).Bruce Wayne be voice Kevin Conroy who do good batman . now look superman . there be nothing that set apart both look same , Bruce Wayne now have blue eyes.Night Wing really need haircut , please ! Alfred just have pupil eye , look more character 80's.I have watch three episode Disc 1 series and already find version be more violent and graphic ( there be blood episode).If be fan Batman : animated series , there be batman season 4 . just include series season 4 marketability . just release New batman adventure do n't think many people would have buy it.Save disappointment and stick season 1-3 .

usually , do n't think Hollywood production be fit be call film , so call ' movie ' instead . but piece elephant manure , be noteven fit be call movie , hence quote title.Where shall i start ? 1 . be n't start geriatric casting , sure be epitome . Stefanie Powers be suppose play someone even LESS half her age , be suppose play 18 year old , and be FORTY eff TWO ! ! ! !2 . horrible and stupid mindless portrayal Paris and France , where see clich character such : sympathetic grumpy shop owner , bitchy queen model , fairy god mother ex-queen model , etc. film be surpass only respect Da Vinci Code , ( which reviewer correctly determine be comedy).3 . be highly and utterly ridiculous have nudity film time and place where nudity be so common place , especially whole focus be about that4 . horrible accent ! ! ! 5 . Nana Mouskouri elevator-music ! ! ! could go , but i think be enough . and be able make observation watch crap just half hour , While surf Internet and talk my friend math equation ... mean ... ! ! ! ! ! invite everyone add my list . : ) :P :D
just stilted rip-off infinitely good " Murder , she Wrote " , be absolutely amazing poorly-written garbage last full eight year . be sure most people who watch unentertaining crap be their sixty and seventy and just tune have nothing well do , or simply remember its star old Dick Van Dyke Show . Van Dyke , who only have decent career 1960s , never be much actor ( his own admission ) and be already far too old play doctor when series begin 1993 . look absolutely ancient result year chain smoking and heavy drinking . his talentless real life son Barry , wooden actor who have rarely be anything that do n't involve his father , play his son series .
be nice guy , and like think genre-tolerant . and , guess , mean try consider movie context genre reside . nothing else , that save feel should be say really nasty thing people or film , which do n't like doing.The plot one be patently obvious , production value very low and set , uhm , simplistic . acting rise " good high school play " territory time time . my feeling be be film day -- please tell was.Worst , sex , reasonably plentiful , be fairly mundane , hamper , least my copy , " sound-over " that be inconsistent action ( climatic moan and shriek lie bed undo bra ? ? ? ) . there be definitely " edge " all--nothing distinguish or interesting , and surprisingly quick cuts.My vote be " 1 " then , follow summary statement : would have be good filler stripper material club be expand , and rest movie condense .
This be yet depressing and boring film AIDS and tragedy . begin very uneventful and predictable and continue movie . keep wait pick-up , but unfortunately never do . acting be fair , but script need lot work . and be look nudity , do n't waste your time nothot actor . due poor sound quality and lack caption , miss 1/8 movie . have never see five gay film , or have recently come term be gay , may find film interesting , otherwise be your run-of-the-mill low budget movie . rank as one bad gay film have ever see .
This have be , far , absolute bad movie have see last 20 year . when see Michael Madsen be figure could n't be too bad movie have be pretty decent film , and be pretty fair actor . wrong ! one should waste their time film . fast forward 80 percent and do n't feel miss thing .
 Everyone else who have comment negatively film have do excellent analysis why film be so bloody awful . be n't go comment , but film just bug so much , and writer/director particular . so must toss my hat join naysayers.I see original " Wicker Man " and really love cornucopia music , sensuality , paganism modern world , and clash theological belief . say , be notpart crowd that think remake great movie should n't be do . example , like original 1950 's " invasion Body Snatchers " , but equally enjoy 1978 remake . film can stand their own . example be " thing " . original , campy look compare today 's standard , have lot be proud 1982 remake Kurt Russell ( my time favorite horror movie ) . small minority people who like " Wicker Man " re-make can notaccuse dissing piece crap just be re-make.This film solidify Neil LaBute 's sexism and misogynistic tendency . also make wonder how executive , want make serious thriller , would green light product that be so anti-female . there be too many scene Cage hit woman just be frustrate thwart his investigation missing girl . would react island other case where suspect be n't forthcoming ? original create society which man and woman be equal participant Goddess base religion . threat main character come everyone , male and female . there be sexual hierarchy.The metaphor bee , drone etc be bit heavy hand and convenient ( " drone must die ! " ) , especially when Cage 's character have bee allergy . keep wonder why man island do n't fight back and use mere physicality stop woman treat grunt . be notwoman special supernatural power , and seem be pregnant , other half old and fat , and rest girl and thin blonde waif , so man really want escape could do what most man do when hate woman . physically dominate . there do n't seem be gun or weapon cut tool hold be unhappy . but be content being drone , why make unable speak ? could be use threat Cage will defend community . be drone Neil LaBute seem believe society run woman would leave man castrate . ( movie be make already . " Stepford Wives " anyone ? ) classic symptom man who be afraid what may happen woman get their sh*t together and be truly equal citizens.The problem man-hating female society be make uninteresting movie viewing and create unintentional humor when Cage start knock woman out . belief LaBute should have leave society egalitarian one , keep sexuality and uninhibited lasciviousness , and push button discomfort regard child island . one like pedophiles or child be sexually exploit . so how would cop react see lewd act perform adult child around ? there would be logical mental leap child be abuse , thus , urgency create save missing child and get help all child . LaBute have say create fianc and daughter story thread give Cage 's character incentive search . do n't think need . child abuse will make adult react save . irony course would be child Cage " save " ultimately bring death.The dialogue be contrived and campy . whole third act be hilarious . audience see guffaw ( and later boo end ) . just think movie start off wrong when letter arrive write fancy handwriting and all flashback cut show how wounded Cage be . do n't need . just show arrive island investigation missing child . most America have see " Law & Order " and other cop procedural . come movie as be Cage 's partner solve mystery.So much potential ... waste . Neil LaBute , stick talk head picture people who enjoy your male angst-ride play and flick sort . stay your own company man . leave thriller people who understand thriller . here be your jar honey . will watch .

One victim think be little odd , but dismiss and decide break anyway.Finally , killing be so fake as be virtually unwatchable.There be reason watch movie , want see breast , and notvery good breast . movie make showgirl virtually indistinguishable Citizen Kane .

film be just distortion , many distortion , so-called ' sin consumerism ' . please note that ' Reverend Billy ' , actor ( Bill Talen ) , be nothing more bureaucrat ' sin consumerism ' . might want ask be question , like : what do ' Reverend Billy ' do living ? how do make his money ? do make his living his ' tax-deductible ' organization ? how do Internal revenue justify ' tax-deductible ' church or organization ? everyone know Christmas be commercialize , but afford one day out whole year which people have opportunity be charitable , and allow significant number people spend time their family , friend , or extended family . everyone be notcharitable . everyone do notspend time their family , friend , or extended family . but , holiday and vacation time give people chance and opportunity . yes , America do have more its share problems--but , perseverance , Americans have and always make great difficulty . and , even time strife , America have prove be great country world . happen when Americans pull together and unite , rather separate and divide . yes , there be problem corporation and monopoly , but will take Americans bring back small business , along ethic responsibly care people live our individual community . yes , globalization have bring its share problem , but will take Americans bring production back America .

Addison make comment man be allow have opinion issue and only one black character be give dignity oppose abortion moral ground . general feeling be oppose abortion , be freak - hardly popular sentiment US . Two main character show nonchalantly mention have abortion when be young and have apology or regret , spite fact research have show woman can undergo intense depression . what be more young girl come clinic abortion and then thank staff way and someone talk how be help young person and be something exult . script could have be write Planned Parenthood.All , be cheap show that lack much future decide present more real relationship rather just totally unbelievable soap opera relationship and far-fetched medical situation whole show .
sit turkey have n't see , and premise sound have potential . be mildly entertaining hurricane sequence . height storm , wind be strong enough blow window out house , yet tree background be perfectly upright and notleaf be move ! fact , when character move house , bright sunlight be visible illuminate treetop . point , whatever credence filmmaker have develop evaporate faster highly localized rain their film . too bad hurricane be n't one , would surely help our homeowner insurance rate here Sunshine State .
Mr Cranky have rate , will be tempt just copy his review and paste here . but have n't , will have give go myself.The only thing give movie 1 instead 0 be Malcolm McDowall 's acting be excellent . however noteven can save film disaster . director must have be really distract when work one be just conglomeration scene that be throw together very little continuity - reminiscent bad ' 70 's movie . even bad , both actor and director appear be make up go which probably show how bad original script was.It be noteven worth discuss story line revolve futuristic corporation call Proxate Corporation who put together crew dispensable people carry dangerous cargo old container/slave ship Nigeria . ship 's computer be baby keep glass jar and wire one crew USB 12 or something . company should have be call Prostate Corporation entertainment value movie be par examination same name.I honestly ca n't find one scene could say be well make and make real sense context movie . only watch end have touch bird flu and movie remind there be people there who be actually bad off - Malcolm McDowall particular . wo n't hold be great actor and great actor be entitle one bad movie their career and one be doosie.So , be only movie your shop hire out or be male and be doctor be n't do prostate examination week and somehow feel be bad thing then give one really wide berth course be really community mind , buy copy support Malcolm and then use drink coaster .
rate movie 2 show complete lack effort try create quality horror film be 10 unintentional funny scale . could n't figure out what be go movie or who people be but do n't care know scene be go have something make cry laughter . dialogue be minimum movie but believe be start film script . fact there be plot line make movie extremely versatile . do n't matter sit down and watch movie begin end or watch rewind will be confuse enjoyment . particularly like scene which inmate be take turn run around beat other stick . believe doctor refer treatment . genius !

TV show be what be , good people bad situation where good IL ' boy come out top . be n't gone Wind but be fun . movie be garbage ! Hollywood ca n't come up anything original take something that be good and ruin $$$$ . only hope movie make 10x 's less cost make . only one be have fun crap be guy who get drive General Lee . audience be victim.Do n't see , watch rerun TV show instead . still hold up 20 year later .
now , flick just out curiosity and have keep watching - same way watch car crash ... appreciate fact be spoof , but that should notstop criticise god-awful directing , act and dialogue . seriously , rate one poor movie have see - look more episode Tales Cryptkeeper , and poor one ... Okay - few criticism ( 1 ) when doctor have his heart attack front monster ( never see monster attack , so assume its heart attack ) , army then launch shell , rocket , bullet monster - which be foot doctor - yet doctor be nottouch missile and be still alive ( 2 ) army attack about 100 yard away , and see flame-thrower be use - geez , thing have range more 30 metre ! ( 3 ) when monster try take professor , soldier run classroom and fire ceiling ; monster drop kid , and soldier do n't try shoot monster ? ? ? come ! ( 4 ) monster look something out Power Rangers ! ( 5 ) there be one scene where five " good guy " ( priest , girl , doctor , reporter and kid ) look shock and get reaction ( line hand mouth ) one other - so natural ! ( 6 ) general just run away , time time ( 7 ) general refuse try electricity and would n't listen ( 8 ) acting be awful ( 9 ) do mention rubber suit monster ? ? ? ?

My wife and just finish movie and come IMDb commiserate reviewer that find movie less satisfactory . however , 10 page review , only handful be negative . feel movie be great concept go horribly awry and want warn who be look watch movie future.I admit , be more inspire write review when do n't like movie when do , so my handful review be all negative . still , that do n't mean be bias notenjoy movie , but often find more eloquent review movie do enjoy.Paris Je t'aime be most pretentious movie have see year . use " intelligent " concept and attach big talent couple way many short story , movie end up bad world . be art art sake , but something 2 year old could dream up and accomplish . give director free reign 5 minute screen time prove why there be division labor even entertainment . director ca n't write , writer ca n't direct . ( will like throw in also Clint Eastwood be overrate , but be be actor turn director { which rarely work , either}).What end up screen be garble mess short story that do n't make sense , be notcomplete 5 minute and total , spoil Paris . why call Paris Je t'aime when more apropos title be cluster f*ck ? there be only couple story that be watchable , most notably piece Alfonso Cuarn , but everything else will fall obscurity . Coen brother short be passable , but can name movie that do notcontain scene pick guitar ? be as all director decide do whatever be want do and choose Paris place do . all love Paris , present company include , be blind fact movie SUCKS . fact , think put director name short director see how poor film be and decide make sure be blame only their 5 minute . seriously . SERIOUSLY.People , Natalie Portman be notgood actress . be be notpixie dream girl wait be . and Maggie Gyllenhaal , why ? ! ? be people act or just regurgitate performance other movie ? be look Natalie Portman ( Garden State , Closer ) , Elijah Wood ( Sin City ) and Catalina Sandino Moreno ( Maria Full Grace).One final comment act : give double kudos Nick Nolte act and look more humane have age or perhaps ever will again . find his short youtube his 5 minute be quite enjoyable.Writing short story be very difficult and only handful author have get right . be think Ernst Hemingway , Raymond Carver , F. Scott Fitzgerald , and John Cheever , just name few . be much harder write full novel and only truly talented can accomplish . same can be say short film . appear only one director will live annals history.If uphold Paris gem be discover and reflect your own lens your own story , then do n't expect enjoy movie . director either do n't care or be lazy . scenario , time be read mean rent . praise be do n't pay 10 dollar head theater .

there really be n't much story film . loosely base off event first Lion King movie . be suppose be how Timon and Pumbaa meet their aloneness . but there be n't much more that.It mix scene original , then ab-libs about how movie change little bit . but still , be ? be hope something little more . instead , all have show be empty plot little explanation.I guess want see other meerkat Lion King universe , then be . but other , do little justice animator . Disney really should stop direct-to-video production . really be quite boring and could have use Jason Statham . " d- "
Attack Killer Tomatoes be " parody " bad monster movie which end up be bad movie spoof . ( very meager ) story tell tomato who revolt who treat badly . Basically,they spin and growl ( yes,they growl ) and next thing know person be cover ketchup . actor be no-names who never make movie this,so there would be point name . there be guy who be hire governement try and stop menace tomato . be accompany black guy who be master disguise and girl and guy who dive . anyway , there be woman who spy first guy that work government . be n't make much sense , understand . movie never would have be very good first place , but even lack fun laugh stupid attack scene . movie be horribly cheezy , which be whole point,really really hurt what could have be ( reasonably ) entertaining movie . one point , giant wax tomato " slide " unconcealed plank wood wheel ! maybe would have recommend movie would have enjoyable camp value , but even be lack terrible movie . negative
This be one lame movie watch last few month predictable plot line and pretty bad acting ( mainly supporting character ) . interview Hugh Laurie DVD be actually more rewarding film ... Hugh Laurie obviously put lot effort learn how dance Samba but scope his character only require immerse kiddie end pool . movie be base appearance lovely girl and great music but be notsufficient make good entertainment.If have never see Rio , or inside British bank , film be . 2 out 10 .
there be notone original idea story . theme be pull various source ; few be Ninth Gate , Mouth Madness ( Carpenter film ) , and Ring . even go as far feature same damn glowing circle Ring and use film 's namesake . soundtrack Cody Carpenter be all but lift Suspiria . hopefully one will oppose comment spew word homage around . yes , see theater be play Argento 's Deep Red . claim homage would be bullshit cop-out . be bottom-of-the-barrel . throw gore and " disturbing " imagery pot do notmake good horror film . Carpenter use know . should fade obscurity or acquire time machine .
Why do movie maker always go author 's work ? mean , yes , thing have be condense sake viewer interest , but look Anne Green Gables . do wonderful job combine important event cohesive whole that be simply delightful . ca n't believe choose combine three novel together Anne Avonlea such dreadful mess . look miss out do . . . Paul Irving , little Elizabeth , widow , Windy Poplars . . . and Anne 's college year , heaven 's sake ! ! ! would n't have be delightful meet Priscilla and all rest Redmond gang ? Kevin Sullivan should have take thing one movie time , instead jumble all together and combine character and event way do . movie be good , leave novel out ! ! but L.M. Montgomery 's beautiful work be something that should notbe deny . movie be let down see successful way Brough Anne Green Gables life .
do notWATCH This Sad EXCUSE Film . have waste time and money and be pretty p**sed off it.The acting be comparable high school play . script be shocking . there be plot . Twenty minute end ( which believe should be reward reach ) have headache all scream , cry and wail five girl make.The majority violence be ( rare film nowadays ) suggest rather graphically depict but find character so damn irritate want see , and indeed single person involve making piece s**t , die most horrible way possible.I spend ten more minute my life save very poor 100 minute . do n't do .
This be pretty much first Jason Scott Lee film have see . say pretty much , have also see Soldier , which play villain ... but what have hear , be notconsider Jason Scott Lee film . , however , be . and be indication quality such film , wo n't be see other . Lee be basically passable martial art artist ... lead , be awful . get fight random no-name character few minute film , probably script writer could n't figure out how else stretch out film minimum require run time feature film . villain be only character even hint personality , and aside fact be certifiably insane , barely seem villain . majority film be basically Lee chase villain time ... or maybe be other way around . ca n't say sure ... and definitely would n't watch again make sure . effect be notcompletely horrible ... but be close . title come popular idea use time-machine go and kill Hitler . somehow , film screw up interesting idea well . plot be too complicate its own good . pace be poor . ca n't think one positive thing say film ... really ca n't . be simply too formulaic and pointless . only have time-machine , so could go back and prevent film ever be make ... no , never mind . just hope few fragile mind be expose as possible . listen negative reviewer . avoid turkey . recommend fan Lee , and one else . be look quality film ... well , be n't . be sure . negative
This would have be *great* silent film . acting really be good , least Look Ma , be Doing really big acting ! sort way.Everything be Huge . line be profound ! scene be SHATTERED By Human TRAGEDY ! mostly , feel gag . yet , train wreck , could n't tear my eye away . dialogue might have work stage , doubt . screen , be cluttered , haphazard , hackneyed and pretty much other stereotypical negative adjective can come up describe really bad dramatic work.If enjoy your melodrama huge , heaping dose , *might* enjoy movie . be prepare wait , however . all melodrama , thing sure plod along its own pace.This script must have sound lot different when actor involve be read . simply do n't work get around deliver front camera.IMDB do great disservice , time , when use its goofy computer-control " weighted score " . curse Starving Class deserve less 1.Character-driven fiction be great , but when develop your character simply push hoop plausible explanation their maturation or evolution , be n't character development ! your character must have motivation . be drink while and wake up field be *not* character development . be plot contrivance.Stay away movie . or very least , watch muted . perhaps will get amusement all arm-waving character do.Oh , and word wise -- prove be truly artsy film , see James Woods all his dangly male " look-at-me , I'm-the-figurative-and-literal-representation-of-the-naked-vulnerability-of- man " glory.Do n't say be n't warn .
 Alone Dark be one my favorite role-playing-games time . remember spend whole night face PC screen , try escape mansion and actually be startle time when monster come surprisingly charge . now , mind - be weary " computer-game-generated " movie . do n't remember single success story new Hollywood genre , be entertain enough be watchable . and yet , be such big fan game could n't resist . my rationale be movie have plot so much as resemble game be , would be OK.Man , be 90 minute ( which seem 300 ) my life will never get back . have chance , would have gladly spend rearrange my sock drawer instead . be n't even " so bad be funny " category . would think even Christian Slater have bit more sense join stink bomb . now , Tara Reid ... be notcomplain her presence . however , purpose put chick star role be have sex scene , - which totally understand and support ( hey , be guy ! ) - have see more her body press conferences.There be plot speak . wo n't waste your time pitch . credibility story sink ' do nothave sex Ms. Lewinski ' . acting be but few notch above ' Street Fighter ' , which , way , be one bad movie have see , would recommend Over one.Kids , recommend Video Game . have far good story , act and much more thrill . as movie , here be spoiler - stink ! wait porno version .
like end-of-days movie . like B-movies . be hope would like movie.I could ignore poor effect , often atrocious music , cringe-inducing line . could ignore unexplained event , and fact movie constantly rely deus ex machina be excusable , give subject matter . could ignore fact people who fight hunger and try reach world peace be bad guy . none thing kill movie . what kill movie be be just plain and simple boring . nothing actually happen ; almost scene movie be design push movie creator ' moral viewer , cost actually have coherent story , or kind suspense.If be look entertaining B-movie , look elsewhere . movie be just boring .
The Leap Years star heavy hitter local and regional film and television scene . and yet , can save movie . have so many thing go - act , overly melodramatic , poor script , inconsistent direction ; and too few thing go - decent music , good cinematography . comment be mainly anyone who throw local movie one basket watch film and say local movie be bad . please do notjudge rest base one film . be television soap opera masquerade romantic feature film . my hope be high when buy my ticket and my hope be dash five minute film .

have n't see , & do n't plan see movie or other that include Lindsay ... ... & " poor little rich girl " straighten out her life 2 year period begin her most recent arrest July 2007.In fact , do n't know anyone that have go see ANY Lindsay 's recent movie . rather imagine 2007 will be high water mark her movie make career , clean up her act . recent publicity have only hinder her movie make career , have further aspiration make more moviesUp time , movie producer have actively seek Lindsay role their upcoming production . now , Lindsay will probably have go audition & actually compete ANY role . her reputation be currently " poison " & quite possible could have negative effect box office ticket sale movie be in.Sooooo ... .now Lindsay be go have deal " notbe want " ... ..is go be able handle ? wonder even Jay Leno will want have Lindsay back his TV show ? forego be merely my opinion . have inside information .
can life explain what popularity child 's television show , power ranger be about.I never understand why unsuspecting child like show first place , character seem so idiotic and notworth caring whatsoever.The costume look completely atrocious , like Multi color spandex people wear go gym.What exactly be purpose show anyways , but kid learn how fight solve their problem ? what be up awful hair cut , and clothing show anyway ? notmention show be still play cable television , just make money teach kid how fight other when disagree certain problem.There be far good entertainment today 's child , hopefully be n't as gullible kid 1990s who watch show.Oh , and what be up homo erotic tension red and green ranger anyway ?
who be too young know or who have forget , Disney company go almost down tube end 1980s . people be notsee their movie anymore and company be notproduce usual wholesome material ... .at least no what people expect . major problem : profanity.Yes , idiot run Disney movie decade would produce film swear word - include Lord 's name vain , can believe - intersperse " family film . " fact that happen twice here first 20 minute ! movie , addition language problem , have nasty tone , too , which make unlikeable almost right beginning . thankfully , Disney wake up and have produce lot great material decadent ' 80s movie . ( " Touchstone " be Disney , just name . )
movie be just other dutch movie , so enjoy movie such Turk fruit and de kleine blonde dood . then might be okay one ( even two have much good story and actor ) Zomerhitte start strong enough , but even one good scene end have nothing do storyline . there be lot nudity ( but and other just could notfind girl attractive ) , dialog be laughable ( do lot annoyance other movie watcher ) , and scene be so completely random be more unintentional comedy anything else ( random scene which owl rip somebody 's eye out ... have nothing do anything and be only reference once later sentence say " do hear what happen ... be there " ) . only reason give 2 be place be look nice ... that be . and reason see be go sneak preview ( here Holland have strange system regard sneak preview , pay less money then regular movie and do n't know what movie be will be watch . all know be be new movie that be notyet theater ) . my advice be stay far away film , really want see good dutch movie watch temmink or zwartboek .
One silly movie 1940s , unbearable haunted house comedy music star Kay Kyser . Kyer , orchestra leader and radio-star ( and eternal college fraternity goof-off ) , be sort precursor Spike Jones , ham up his guest and back up willingly his merry troupe musician . be hire play birthday party gloomy mansion , kind where poison dart import Africa be frame and hang wall . shindig be beset creepy judge , scary professor , ominous swami , lot giggly female , and enough bad joke fill three Bob Hope picture . song ( Jimmy McHugh and Johnny Mercer ) be nothing brag out , and be over-confident Kyser , yukk up elbow-in-the-ribs material that turn 1940 back ten year . * ****
@card@ second , already realize there be real budget cheap knock-off . story be take great movie " Texas Chainsaw Massacre " and " Hills have eye " . like kind movie , even be duplicate well ( wrong turn , Timber Falls , Carver).But " Side Sho " be hard watch : actor be really bad , dialogue be cheesy and music be stupid and totally misplace . do notcare what happen character . so-called bad guy be also notinteresting all and rather stereotypical . so how about blood and gore ? well there be , be rather cheap and action be execute very poorly . 2 Points , just gore and blood but do understand be hardly worth look , even gore-hounds. .
short , movie be completely worthless.The idea be make movie point view what someone early 1900s might think future . interesting idea , but lack compelling story or character prevent ever suspend our disbelief , so idea just flops.Apparently whole movie be do actor front green screen and be suppose be impress . but graphics person , softening be obvious crutch hide difficult sharp edge problem green screening . color be majorly wash out relevant effect reduce visual quality . and do n't understand why anyone would consider anything render movie be way ground breaking . anything , ridiculous retrograde graphics have lower bar really bad graphics -- do n't measure up even ancient Jurassic Park graphics . model robot be so simple , plain and very uncompelling . there be bunch weirdo prehistoric-like animal island , but be notexplain way.The story be horrible belief . fact ca n't believe do n't just walk out movie . relationship Polly and Joe be unmotivated , and movie be base distrust and deception . why be Morris Paley character even there ? be notway convince Joe be heroic -- mean fly plane , and save one person ( Polly ) personal reason . yeah there be great hero . Dex have very little screen time , so why be suppose care Joe want save ? who be Nepalease that lock Joe and Polly mine vault , and why would do ( remember entire Totenkopf operation be robotic ) ? plot hole : ( 1 ) why do Bai Ling 's character ( major fall her excellent character " Crow " ) halt robot who have capture Joe ? be look vial , and have notfind . ( 2 ) why hell would Dex be capture but notkill ( do n't have or know vial , and bad guy do n't know Polly have vial and be connect Joe and therefore Dex ) ? ( 3 ) Polly indicate " " do n't know anything Totenkopf , yet have secret source that contain what appear be fairly complete FBI-style file . ( 4 ) blank spot map as describe Nepalese -- know mysterious area , then why hell be their map blank spot ? ( 5 ) one point , Polly and Joe have give up their clothes ( be burn ) -- Joe be give new clothes that be identical his old clothes , yet Polly be force wear very odd look bulky dress , then same line continuity suddenly Polly have her original clothes back.*sigh* . how far off be suppose switch my brain watch crap ? be suppose be exhilarate over produce music , even when nothing interesting or remotely exhilarate be happen screen.And acting ? be suppose be impress bunch bad British accent ? which character be n't annoy ? think Ling Bai 's dialogue be probably good whole movie ( do n't have single line ) . dialogue be n't camp , and do n't even rise level cheese . its just bad and annoy . people be n't hero 's or compelling ; be kind people would try ignore or disassociate ever have misfortune meet real life.I ca n't believe movie get above average rating here IMDb . IMHO should be compete " Batman Forever " bottom 100 time .
where do begin movie bad ? do mention cast unlikeable hero ? over-the-top acting ? dreadful script ? No. just say anyone who pay money see film poor need their head look . know do . respect poor guy who see little or advance word mag Empire ( usually bad sign preview copy be n't available quality movie mag ) . however , cinema really should start think give out refund customer be n't happy finished product.I go three day open two other mate . only other person cinema be one bloke his own.And that be cheap night.Either ad campaign have fail dismally or word have spread most country just what stinker is.Not day Avengers ( 1998 ) have feel so short change watch movie . mate come round video few month make sure pay your electricity bill watch it.Tara Fitzgerald deserve award notcrack up - or walk off set ; Keith Allen retain dignity cinematic carnage ; Barry Foster should have be arrest set his performance , Rhys Ifans do his career no favour success Notting Hill and only Dani Behr be halfway likeable busty secretary.Mind , consider use be Word , viewer ' expectation her acting ability have be pretty low begin with.The production value be n't bad consider obviously limited budget but script be atrocious . want hear bunch unlikeable character say " Fak ! " couple hour then should be right your street.Otherwise , bargepoles require .
be Evangelical Christian then make Egyptian and avoid biblical plague.Awful - why oh why do IMDb list most favourable review top list - be due one that have just waste end what start out good evening claptrap.The plot premise start out strong enough - be draw film and be interested right up point where Bible sermon take over . what waste.This film have so incense have register IMDb first time just complain - hope least do save someone else 's evening.Hay - what Christian act my part ; - )
figure be French film , LOL , emphasis young girl much old man ... why be French be so fixate kind thing ? when age difference be great , really come off pervy ! Valentina Cervi be beautiful ( bear strong resemblance Olivia Hussey , Zeffirelli 's ' 68 Romeo and Juliet , set similar period ) , but look about 15 and actor play Tassi , her painting instructor , look ... well , @card@ be KIND.Other poster have do work explain historical record ( unusually detailed case ) real Artemisia , great artist and one earliest recognize female painter period ( 17th century ) . her story speak modern time particularly age-old accusation " great artist be man " -- pretty much blast assertion bit -- and story her rape trial be so poignant . notonly be clearly assault , and force degrading sexual relationship ( day marriage your assaulter be only way avoid social shame ) , but Tassi be serial rapist and possibly kill his wife and child.The movie do terrible disservice invert truly fascinating and remarkable real life story -- very dramatic and notneed " spice up " -- weird Frencified way , have " hot " have oversexed teenager draw male sexual organ and have hot love affair man old enough be her grandfather . be " sexy " -- truth be boring and seem too feminist/politically correct.It also disturb be only part Artemisia life consider interesting enough film . fact paint decade ( her famous painting Judith beheading Holfernes be paint AFTER , notrape ) , be first woman admit prestigious Florentine Academy , that go on have child ... oh that be bore stuff . , that be about middle age woman and be n't " hot " teenagers.I understand there be lot creative license make film ( or book ) real historical character . need create dialog , have subplot , create dramatic structure . certainly detail can be sacrifice -- be big deal date be move few year , or Artemisia be play blonde actress ( when know her self portrait be brunette ... and big bone one , notskinny minny ) , or something . but turn her story around , and make rape romance be actually sick and disturbing . be even bad director be female . should be horribly ashamed ! like ( and know people could care less real woman artist and just period costume and hot sex ) , will probably like " dangerous beauty " Rufus Sewell and Catherine McCormack . similarly base heavily re-written history , lot heave bosom and jewel encrust goblet : Bon Appetit !
Okay . Look- have see LOTS and do mean lot type film . know , one where DVD cover just look so good and scaarrryyy just cant Wait see ? well , get Got again . and be get ' pretty tired . but digress . be pretty simple . sucked(I know , rather juvenile ) but do . Andi So agree other poster have sit boring thing , why oh why do lead actress have be so unnattractive ? distractingly so may add . and scowl use convey unresolved pain/grief death her daughter do little help . mean , Jesus. . oh , but crawling-on-her-back-demon thingee be pretty neat ...
ah yes 1980s , time Reaganomics and Sly , Chuck and host other action star hide remote jungle blow away commie . time couldn`t believe how movie Rambo , MISSING Action and UNCOMMON VALOR ( and who can forget ridiculous Red Dawn ? ) make money box office , they`re turgid action crap fests rather put right wing agenda and have date very badly . TROMA`S WAR be tongue cheek take type movie but you`ve get ask do need spoof first place ? course not. TROMA`S WAR lack sort sophistication - do make point there`s real difference right wing tyrant and leave wing one - and sometimes feel more grade z movie send up . maybe be ?

how can movie have Ozzy Osbourne and still suck ? just do n't get . Trick or Treat manage do . suck and like it.Trick or Treat be one movie have warn people about . be vomit-inducing vile atrocity just beg be view can feel much bad . Trick or Treat have redeeming factors.For movie heavy metal , sure do n't seem grasp what heavy metal be or what represent . movie manage make heavy metal look lame and be 1986 , probably one heavy metal 's strong hour . be quite feat , however negative.Trick or Treat = so bad will be angry have watch . simple equation will hopefully keep away brainless and gutless film .
see Crispin Glover 's " what be ? " Ann Arbor film festival . admittedly , film be least aptly name , get distinct sense even writer/director could provide answer . question and answer session screening , Mr. Glover say film be originally mean be short film show virtue use actor down-syndrome . however , be notenough reason create film . actor be , my opinion , build block large vision - large vision that seem muddle good and absent worst.Crispin Glover also say want address taboo subject . well , do do . but why ? film seem have stance , reason address anything . do feel thing should n't be taboo ? film do n't even give indicator . taboo sake taboo be notinteresting . ca n't even afford make taboo disturb or incite level have n't make audience care way.Ignoring problem concept moment , thing that actually shock most be how poorly film be put together . edit , cinematography , and other technical aspect seem frequently be extremely amateur . Glover say 125-150 thousand dollar go movie , and feel money should have be spend different designer ( Glover actually do design - know see least sound design credit ) . painted set be okay ( notgreat ) , but use poorly . part feel photograph stage play - which would be fine that go sort purpose , but Glover 's hand just feel sloppy . other part be film sort Home Movie , inferior quality lot stuff see first-time filmmaker do iMovie.Perhaps big problem " what be ? " be ca n't even understand how seriously film be be take . there be part that feel Glover be scream think seriously . other point , seem off his own little joke . perhaps mean be ironic , or meaningful way , but just feel Glover could n't even get give his film sort serious attention.Glover say originally want be short film . only have be . seventy-two minute , film run out imagery and idea first twenty , and be arguable idea be formulate enough claim be even there period time .
This be nothorror film , but boring sex movie . very bad movie , be avoid serious horror fan . plot , awful act and annoy music . only watch trailer will know enough ... be shame such thing be available VBS or video there be so many good movie unavailable . like vampire try Hammer Productions or Italian Gothic Mario Bava and Antonio Margheriti instead . be masterpiece compare trash . rating = even " 1 " be too much ! and believe , be notonly one opinion .

film seem be rip off many movie that have deal same subject past . let future viewer be forewarn " Art Heist " do n't add anything genre . Director Bryan Goeres have clue what do film.William Baldwin keep reappear film , and frankly , wonder have great agent , or be director and producer love his unusual goofy look , compliment strange hairdo sport most his movie . only good movie which have appear , be " Squid and Whale " , which only speak two , or three line .

ONLY person who sound genuine be Brenda Aoki. . find amazing be promote comedy , do n't laugh once . even More surprise be CBS morning news call " refreshing breath comedy " . be neither refresh , nor breath comedy . and end be very predictable , previous reviewer must be idiot think such things.AVOID film want see boring predictable plot line and wooden act . actually think " Spike Bensonhurst " be good act film ... and walk out way film !

 review,a list good point and bad points.I will start bad.Bad points:The casting choices(especially Burt Reynolds Boss Hogg),the act say badly choose cast,the storyline,the idea set film modern day,the direction,the editing,the soundtrack,and all,the whole idea make feature film television series that be n't great start with,despite be popularity.Good points:Jessica Simpson red bikini ... ... ... ... that be ! might make analogy here.In scene where Jessica Simpson Daisy Duke strut her way up Michael Weston Enos,and ask question,"Enos,where 's Boss Hogg and Roscoe ? " ,in his clouded judgment , tell where are.She might just as well have asked,"Enos,is good movie ? " ,the red bikini would have cloud his judgment say yes,even his right mind would have said,"No , notreally."As good look bikini,she could have be stark naked,and even would nothave save horrible piece film-making.Stay out Hazzard !
Holy freak God all-freaking-mighty . movie be so bad , think be drug . bad way ... character acting be poor thing have see quite time . movie be more akin Lord G-Strings , IMHO(it be real movie ) . most movie appear be do horrible green screen . my favorite part be when be carriage , and can tell there be horse . be flee alien monster , and go same speed swift jog . then switch far-shot ridiculous CG horse . and CG general seem be sub-par 1992 's mind 's Eye . mean , come , really . feel horrible episode Hercules , only Kevin Sorbo there save day . bad . movie . ever .
be age 10 and 14 ( R rating ) , there be very few thing like here . One or two line Kenan Thompson , David Koechner ( really should see more ) and Sam Jackson be humorous and Julianna Margulies be as good can be consider her surroundings , but sadly , that be . poor plot . poor acting . bad writing and delivery . special effect be dismal . as much entire situation be odd and awful joke , significant individual embed situation be all equally terrible . consider action portion , well there be unbelievable action sequence film that make giddy and there be that make groan . movie only contain latter kind . leave little leave . be so glad do notpay this.Despite hype , can read and think , so sit down watch , do notexpect anything good . have expectation , but be somewhat worry go . yet , train wreck , can merely look away . and even expectation , be let down . bad . noteven ' so bad , be good ' material . be _very_ tolerant bad movie , but make " Six String Samurai " ( which like ) Oscar worthy.No , piece CGI will rubbish be same company Battlefield Earth , Little Man and Gigli . how be currently rate 7.2 completely mystify . brainwashing or somehow stack voting system be all can think answers.I could go on and on but suffice say tonight , witness train wreck . need go wash my eye . 1 10
 strangely-lackadaisical apocalypse , world suffer dual plague zombie and vampire , but one seem be too worry Grade-Z film which bare less resemblance Sheridan Le Fanu 's famous short novel my mother 's lasagna recipe . bored attendant still run gas station and doctor still make house call and helpful police officer still show up radiator fluid just when need . plot , and use term loosely , involve father and daughter try rendevous " general , " whose daughter be miss , church kill vampire who , very conveniently , happen be travel father and daughter . must confess moment or two genuine humor can be find vast stretch unintentional humor . film also boast just enough nudity keep boy fourteen interested . anyone old beware .
could be one bad movie i have ever see . i do n't see how could ever be describe horror movie , or even thriller ? its more lumbering drama . scary music be excellent but there be n't scary situation director think would be good idea use everyday activity take dump or walk down stair . movie have so much potential . have beautiful cinematography ( sp ? ) and interesting character , but seem as writer assume already know . would undergo peculiar activity explanation or even clue what mean . be simply one movie that say its about one thing and something totally different .

film be just shame . Orlando , Florida seem become more recognize filmmak area ( Vancouver 's rise prominance ) . Brothers be shoot Central Florida and short film be bit setback area ( which make great stride Indie film Walking Africa and great HBO minisery earth Moon).I will try be as honest possible . think Orlando be perfect place film Brothers . have potential give new spin the ' Boy Band ' craze . , both N'Sync and Backstreet Boys come area . but , Brothers fall short probably weak script . both lead character be flat almost development ( part could be amatuer actor , but be certainly way script be written).Also problem be choice joke . many joke be too repetitive ( do come off funny first time , but do grow be bit boring ) . ' concert ' scene be stage poorly ( and many scene also do n't seem move story way).I have high hope one , but alas its disappointing effort . also hope good upcoming feature base short . but think good thing filmmaker John Figg be move different genre ( quickly ) . comedy be n't his strong suit . but , its indisputable definitely be one more prominant filmmaker Orlando area ( its just shame right now be infamous , notfamous ) .
goofy Griswalds win T.V. game show " pig poke " grand prize , and all fly off together Europe where manage cause one stupid disaster . all ridiculous , unfunny money-spinning sequel one beat lot . Harold Ramis ' 1983 film be below average misadventure which misfit family go nightmarish " vacation " States . time Amy Heckerling ( " look who be talk " ) helm what turn out be disastrous " comedy " which will annoy more will make laugh.Hughes script ( Rob Klane ) be awful and wonder why likes Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo bother such dead-beat project , as even Anthony Michael Hall and Imogene Coca have sense decline offer . even omnipotent Michael Palin be unable lift proceeding level could call entertaining.Yet , as inconceivable may seem , " European Vacation " be successful enough warrant second sequel ! surely could n't be as unbearable one . know , have yet see National Lampoon show that be worth bother.Monday , December 26 , 1994 - T.V.

normally only write review movie really hate or really like . and , can probably tell number star up there , do n't like . now , assume have read plot or maybe even see movie , so will skip summary . let be break down , pro and cons:Cons : concept : premise be set up be interesting . use Chaos theory theme be interesting . however , be n't carry out so well . correct be wrong , but seem Chaos theory be kind misrepresent . event that occur movie seem more contrived coincidence anything . guess Butterfly effect be represent whole " God(s) cause Tsunami bring back statue . " presentation come off as really sloppy though . people call intelligent , but just seem be souped action film.Storyline : be just , or do seem Kamal just throw together give excuse play ten role ? plot be extremely contrived ; Govind keep lose vial many time obscure accident ( his friend just happen mix up vial package be send India , crazy old lady just happen throw vial idol , half cast just happen unexpectedly meet up same hospital , and case idol just happen get mix up one that belong famous singer.)CGI : oh god , CGI . be even bad special effect Jaws 3 , and suck . right away , could tell which part be animate . even my ten-year-old cousin know underwater car do n't look that.Stunts : yes , now action scene Tamil movie be n't realistic , but stunt one be horrid and actually distract story.Make up : have admit , do good job expect . think Kamal would be play people similar skin tone , so two fake white guy and fake Japanese Aikido guy catch guard . however , be still pretty bad , could easily tell which one be wear masks.The song : music be distract and out-of-place many instances.Asin : her character be possibly most annoy one movie . be loud , ditsy , and obsess irrationally idol . actually find wish would die.Plot hole and Fridge Logic : let get straight : lab monkey be smart enough get password-locked door , but notintelligent enough tell difference bar chocolate and vial deadly virus . and then , ex-CIA agent who be vial figure be head India . instead immediately follow , marry pole dancer first . famous Punjabi singer cancer check small town hospital third world when could easily afford well medical treatment available . furthermore , get shot throat bullet . will think would be kill , but instead , magic bullet have clear his tumor . read right , BULLET knock out tumor.Pros ... Naidu Character : possibly only likable part movie be his comedy .

Huh ? that totally do notfollow . and even do , do n't see how help his argument . mean , his idea ever become common assumption then guess would have assume be false too , base his own reasoning .

This be one bad movie have ever see ! see Toronto film festival and totally regret waste my time . completely unwatchable redeeming quality whatsoever.Steer clear .
First off , would like say be fan Chris Rock . like his other movie , but movie be just my summary . Biggest Sack Crap ever . beginning , Chris Rock play aspiring comedian who get stage fright Comedy Building call Apollo . his way home gig , ride his bike see woman like and be hit Truck . little while later , choose body old , white , and selfish millionaire . then , dress up music group Outkast try replay scene original where come out Jockey . second , go back Apollo , and try be comedian try be his previous body and start dissing white population and try be black . do get my drift ? movie be awful try too hard be original and process come look sack crap . just take my advice , do n't even watch movie .
 SPOILERS ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !I watch half movie and do n't it.First reason : bore . barely anything happen , woman sit around and discuss how terrible their life be and how have hope , smoke weed , read magazine , care their sick friend , and cut up occasional dead body . boring ! ! ! !Second reason : there be too many thing leave unexplained . many scene be dedicate zombie hunter who kidnap random man , restrain chair and interrogate . who be man ? how do know anything illegal activity concern diseased flesh eater ? why do kill and let one go ? also there be dude who first think also have flesh eat disease but put his fist wall superhuman strength suggest be notquite what originally thought-never explain ! how frustrate be that ? conclusion : find woman annoy , story uninteresting , duologue tedious , and action non-existent . also cover art be mislead make believe movie be go be cool when clearly be n't . rent movie base review make other people website , and respect fact people might have enjoy flick , will now make sure read more two review deep movie so as avoid rent movie regret see .
Oh my . how can make movie such beauty , but that be so terribly bad . mean , even Uwe Boll do n't make crap . there be noteven hint decent story , multi-layered character , or attraction . be just random sequence pointless chatter join together make ' movie ' . suppose only child up 3 year age could enjoy , give world be so utterly dimensionless and story so incoherent , anyone old would be annoy . but then again , be far too scary anyone 6 year age , there be probably one that should watch movie all.Take my advice and stay far , far away movie . your little daughter can make good storyline , and probably be n't able draw picture this pretty , her tale be much more worth listen . and please , name whoever believe , do notexpose your child piece **** . will give 2 10 , and be exclusively graphics , story and character development be so awful will deserve negative rating.And decide watch anyways ... remember warn .
This be version even author hate , be so schmaltzy . give ' happy ending ' and change lot dialogue , and be just big pile saccharine . ' stage manager ' be quite good , believe originated role , but everyone else fall act style 40 be that be really just pose . one great feature- music . have one good score ever record , and be worth seek out record shop . overall think 1989 Spalding Grey/ Eric Stoltz/ Penelope Miller version be far superior .

version be pretty insipid , be afraid . Jane Eyre be one my favorite book and have be childhood , but William Hurt 's weary , throwaway acting style be completely unsuitable bold passion Edward Rochester and poor Charlotte Gainsbrough look bored , petulant teenager whose dental brace hurt ! also ca n't believe eliminate Edward 's great marriage proposal scene end book , one most moving moment literature . do appreciate finally use such young , plain woman play Jane , character who be suppose be worldly 18 , but want see version that closer approximate personality and passion novel , please see 70 's version George C. Scott and Susannah York . York be too old , tall and pretty play Jane , but one have touch Rochester 's character way Scott do .
The longer film go on-and seem tediously go ever- more annoyed become , as quite frankly , what waste time sit total nonsense . how earth do people get make film this,or indeed receive finance such rubbish ? do n't be fool relatively high rating IMDb just prove can fool people all time . and picture main player have obsession gun , so be notdifficult work out way movie will ultimately unfold . America can never understand rest world find bizarre how society USA have such obscene and fatal ' gun culture'.Anyhow:The lead actor portray loser who escape fantasy world be cowboy Urban sprawl.He come family two spoiled brat child , teenage girl and boy ; take care strict single parent father who can barely cope . cowboy be seduce teenage girl or vice-versa , and impressionable boy be seemingly take lunacy loser.The cowboy spend whole time state unreality and depression.A total loser who prefer go beach then work living , and then commit burglary his family be too lazy make money legally.Ask yourself:Who want watch either sad failed loser fantasy world hold death wish , or indeed view poor family who be effect notmuch well white trash ? !This film be pointless drivel.It only save get low mark possible half listen able music:negative .
How do comment one that be headline high school girl even make site , be stupid movie have ever see , be ridiculous , how can moron sit there and say just movie make jump be good movie , that might be most idiotic thing have ever hear , could sneak up and go " Boo " and would make jump , but that do notmean be qualify write or direct movie , notmention " tie everything together end " be notgood reason movie be well receive . what kind movie would be do n't tie everything together , guess would make half movie , notwhole movie . so basically idiot girl be compliment finish movie , well love how youth today hold medium and production company such high standard . wonder political system country can get away whatever want , have idiot like come up our country , what would happen girl actually end lead something someday , that be scary thought . get life and go watch real movie sometime , try Shawshank Redemption or Waterfront , or something , and do n't comment be " boring " see , just use what little brain God give analyze little .

register just make comment ( which pretty much echo one here already ) acting be bad subpar , expound commonly hold stereotype , have bad display tasteless female objectification ( bod brain ) , and have cheesy line know man.including but notlimit " allright let see what guy can do " should also mention when show crash involve innocent civilian , end up feel bad innocent people and start hate character . Eddie Griffin 's character be also one most stereotypical black guy persona that just rub people wrong way . may or may notbe good actor but movie do n't allow kind character exploration . want movie that leave audience side bad guy ? ocean 11 . movie just make hate bad guy instead capture audience.Even car ca n't make up fluke movie . Enzo Griffin wreck sum movie perfectly . just suck .
This be one seriously disturb movie . even Though boy deserve what get ... ..the sadistic gruesome execution be " slightly " top . only character show conscience early hunt be kill off could offer help sad plot.At beginning movie , there look be promise mediocre affair , but be just ploy lull viewer false sense security , joy what be come.The only thing that could have save movie be Jack Nicholson have jump out bush and yell , " and , where be batman ? " . Kim Basinger could have screamed.Now that would have be cool !
usual , be really look forward new TV/film favourite subject mine - make nice change *strangely familiar* documentary Kursk or Stalingrad history Channel.I avidly look forward Pearl Harbour and Enemy Gates - but be rudely bring down earth realisation malevolent , stupid-ifying power Hollywood - and its ability spend absolute fortune tripe.So yet again get excite ' rise Evil ' , especially hear Ian Kershaw be involve , have enjoy his book . can see why quit.To quote guy responsible rubbish:"The Kershaw book be academic piece , " say . " wasquite dry . need more incidents."Incidents ? be totally nut ? Hitler 's life can be say be ' incident ' - yes Kershaw 's two volume Hitler biography be long and detailed , but be suppose be.The thesis behind ' rise Evil ' seem be:Hitler be very bad man - no be VERY bad man , who HATED jew , and just case miss , be go emphasise fact EVERY scene film.There be effort whatsoever try and explain mood time , and why Hitler may have adopt view and strategy do . needless say - generally excellent ' Nazi - Warning history ' - film neglect point out fact nearly all leader Munich communist rise be Jewish , and may have colour his view subject - and his axiomatic link jew Bolshevism - absolutely crucial aspect understand much Nazi era.But there be notmuch understanding be do - film-makers be n't go go there , just get all stuff know about anyway . certainly do n't get fascinating fact Kershaw allude , which have Hitler briefly be socialist/communist immediately WW1 . would course be far too complex film handle , and might even detract relentless ' be very bad ' mantra which bang away incessantly.We know be bad man . however , also know be mesmerise figure both public speaker and more private situation . could be polite and even sympathetic , and course espouse view vegetarianism , anti-alcohol and anti-smoking many Guardian reader could agree . be also famously fond animal , hence why wholly invent dog-flogging scene be so absurd.He be also , all account have see , brave soldier WW1 . see his Iron Cross , never get see how win ( act bravery be notscript , needless say ) . also get insight whatsoever why be so fire up his war experience , Sassoon , Owen , Brook , Remarque and so many other find so repellent experience . and again , point jewish/bolshevik link , be vital anyone 's understanding subject . why do love war so much ? why do think be always good idea , massive evidence contrary ? why do n't care his colleague who die ? or maybe do - but still draw wrong conclusions.This film certainly do n't have anything interest say either.As all too often day , film be classic example ' make history relevant present ' and invent stuff or leave awkward fact out fit in ' present ' - which all too often be cater low common denominator , where do n't trust your audience inch , so just ram stuff their throat , knowing ( sadly correctly ) will always get away there be so many dumb fool world.History be really about make relevant past and see how colour our present , well and bad . rubbish be great opportunity , lose again . spend million , and location and large scene be impressive , but tell nothing do n't know already , and promote understanding dark period human history.WT

cover art ( which feature man hold scary pellet gun ) would make seem as be martial art film . (Hardly.)I find interesting film 's real title be Trojan Warrior . ( Trojan be brand condom US ) movie be load homoeroticism . like stuff , then film be n't bad really . however , consider points:There be numerous close-up actor ' groin & butt , ( One scene even feature actor erection bulge his pant . ) film be also bath gaudy color lime , peach , and red . cinematographer 's standpoint , movie be drag queen ! several scene feature character stand EXTREMELY close one , occasionally touch converse . also , cousin hero like woman , and other guy movie be try kill . be there message here filmmaker want convey ? shall go fight scene ? ( yes , someone 's private part get grab one fight . ) martial arts scene be brief and unimaginative . fancy stuff here , just your standard move will see old Chuck Norris flick . there be also car chase scene which may be first ever LOW-speed chase put film .
perhaps big waste production time , money and space video store shelf . someone suggest see movie , run scream other direction . , course , be self-abuse .

appreciate renaissance Asian horror , do n't bother Gawi . film scarcely deserve mention A-list work such Ringu , Tale Two Sisters , Cure , and Ju-On ( or even such good material Eye or Inner Senses ) . film brim subtlety , unexpected imagery , rich character , and decidedly non-Western take what be frightening . Gawi be string together leftover limb and organ everything that have make American horror lousy past twenty-five years.The film try blend Asian ghost story and Hollywood slasher flick , but be bad fit .

who be George C. Scott ? George C. Scott be renowned actor . practically movie have be be well off . now ol ' George have absolutely NOTHING do movie ... , but once say something that describe say movie T.I do n't recall his exact word , but basically say Great Writing can save bad acting , but Great Acting CanNOT Bad Writing . Never have little observation be true " All New Adventures Laurel & Hardy : love or Mummy".The casting two lead be absolutely perfect . Bronson Pinchot ( Laurel ) and Gailard Sartain ( Hardy ) notonly look part , but do exceptionally good job mimick real deal ( mannerism and all ) . movie should stand lasting testament their talent . say , movie fall flat its face when come ( guess ) WRITING.Aside opening dialogue Pinchot and Sartain ( which be very " character " ) and brief gag involve taxi , movie be absolute chore sit through.PROBLEM # 1 : too much time and effort go plot.I do n't want know why mummy want kidnap pretty British lady . what I Want be see Stan and Ollie ( or least , their stand-in ) . way too much screen time be devote explain plot or not-very-funny secondary character that say plot revolve around.However , even movie have be joke , that would still leave ... ... problem # 2 : most joke be what would call " watered-down " slapstick.What do mean " water down " ? slapstick , character get hurt exaggerated way comedic effect ( ala Looney Tunes , 3 stooge ... ,or how Laurel & Hardy ? ).In " watered-down " slapstick ( define ) , character get mildly hurt or inconvenience , and filmmaker play up comedic effect.Maybe illustration would help:In Looney Tunes , Daffy Duck get shot Elmer Fudd . his bill fall off and put back on . be classic slapstick.In " gem " , Ollie accidentally bump people . turn around , tell be careful , and continue their merry way . be notslapstick . be noteven funny . be just ... bore ... and movie be full kind joke . be as be movie 's bread and butter . writer and director just take dull moment and act be suppose be funny . grant , example just give be most extreme case , but can only cut so much slack.Long story short : film just do n't work script fail capitalize Pinchot 's and Sartain 's ability impersonate Stan and Ollie . instead , script capitalize plot exposition and lame joke . watch movie be basically watch two excellent impersonator who be give real material work with.Not good movie , but incredible sleeping aid.I say give one miss and stick real deal ( just so long steer clear " Atoll K " and " Be Big " ) .

film be deeply disappointing . notonly Wenders only display very limited musical spectrum Blues , be his subjective and personal interest part music bring film that make watch and listen absolutely boring . only highlight movie be interview Swedish couple who be befriend J.B. Lenoir and show their private video footage well as tell story . Wenders 's introduction filmic topic start off quite interestingly - allude world 's culture ( or actually , American culture ) travel space , but his limited look theme as well neither funny nor utterly fascinating reproduction story 30s render movie mere sleeping aid . Yawn . have expect more .

documentary revolve Eva Mozes Kor , holocaust survivor , part Mengele 's experiment twin , consist primarily her version what happen Auschwitz , and comparison emotion other survivor twin experiment . movie obviously have great review . be one topic one dare voice contrary opinion about.I too , large part movie , get suck emotion movie-maker so obviously want viewer concentrate on . One user review IMDb Eric Monder ( obviously have nothing critical say issue public forum ) could only find sweet nectar . " one many dramatic sequence , group Jews argue Kor Jewish center , meaning word " forgive " be even debate , but isolate and outnumber Kor hold own " but time , sappy hold movie have my dormant emotional repertoire have let loose enough could see clearly once more . " strong-willed " Eva Kor forgive her " Nazi captor " movie begin delve what forgiving be all about , least viewpoint Kor . movie go follow , her public statement forgive Nazis and new territory . , be meat movie , surround inedible fat her " act forgiveness " . obviously , be very sick cow.On mission test her theory forgiveness , order heal wound past , make her way " promised land " meet Arabs , discuss issue that face and see dialogue can lead good understanding situation and heavily intersperse debate and discussion jew US her act forgive Nazi , include one Jewish center Chicago . then on , anyone notteary eye ca n't see screen will find hard-pressed miss obvious contradiction her statements.Firstly , immediately notice her body language , defensive and unwilling listen room full Arab scholar and teacher . her comment about how fear might kidnap her show how much waste time , effort and money entire act be . rather annoy Dr Sami Advan ( Professor education Bethlehem University ) get just right when tell Kor off statement make about how would rather be asleep apartment.Finally , debate Jewish center Chicago , where be " grilled " meaning forgiveness and her right do so , wake that continue suffering trauma acts.I will cut chase . end movie , be hope have n't choose watch movie . movie be badly make , fail delve deep anything Auschwitz apart purely trivial , just sufficient make sure holocaust be refresh viewer memory and incite barrage tear . show Kor , subject documentary be unable engage fair discussion . her discussion ability be limit parrot her stance forgiveness ( good ) complete unwillingness listen or participate.Lastly , be everyone retarded today ca n't notice difference make peace and forgiving ? quote IMDb user , " do n't see her forgiveness be weak- quite contrary , just want relieve its hold her soul , want suffering be over , so let go . " that would be perfect layman 's definition MAKING PEACE.I guess , world propaganda , blind faith and political correctness , there be room question that have " go more human mind can fathom".P.S . dictionary certainly should go all Books-to-buy list everyone keep make .
actually watch twice theater could notbelieve how bad be first time . maybe have miss something ... nope , what be miss be miss beginning preproduction . actually go back Robbin 's novel see could find problem , and discover what think be funny and exciting back day be now just so much disconnected and fuzzy-headed junk.So , initial problem film be decide do , and rest train wreck progress there . absolutely nothing work - notblessed thing . beautiful exterior photography get steamrol random camera placement interior shot . actor look least uncomfortable - Angie Dickenson look positively mortify - Rain Phoenix , who give impression be too unaware realize how awful her performance really be . dialog be one , long , unwaver cringe . scene do n't make sense second second , and connection be nonexistent . and yet , movie stumble blindly on , convince be say something profound.This be too bad even be funny ; be simply excruciating . Gus Van Zant have do other good-to-great movie which encourage see , and be happy survive ( and appear have learn ) mess .
truly unpleasant film . Rick Baker 's special effect be quite impressive ( stomach-turning ) , have other redeeming feature . many 70s movie , leave feel as need take long shower , and scrub slime off . character be uniformly unpleasant , and plot make sense .
 Words fail me.And that be n't common.Done properly could have be great , funny spoof B-movie sci-fi , but sadly , be notbe . rarely field drama have so many competent actor struggle so vainly such dogs-breakfast script . can only endorse previous reviewer 's comment - go clean bathroom . fact do anything watch film.Positives : Lucy Beeman 's nose . negative : everything else.Most apposite line : " be n't go anywhere".If only plastic surgeon could meet such fate .
year remember reading show " trouble Tracy " TV Guide . CFTO-TV Toronto Saturday morning 6 am ! live two-hour drive north Toronto and could n't get CFTO , but know how be - always want what ca n't have.Well , know what want and what want be see what " trouble Tracy " be all about . do have beautiful girl star role ? be there nudity ? be there suspense ? be comedy ? would have be fine there be promotion show . least could have know what be miss . but , No ! mystery drive bonkers , CTV affiliate CKCO build re-transmitter Wiarton , Ontario and begin broadcast " trouble Tracy " same time CFTO ... .Saturday morning 6 am ! ! One Saturday morning get up and turn TV 5:59 and last get see what " trouble Tracy " be . yes , " trouble Tracy " be be Canadian content and stick harmless 6 be spot one would ever see how awful was.Talented Canadian Actor Steve Weston die few year afterward , but many would argue effectively " die " first time appear show . when see first time cold Saturday morning and fall despondent back my bed , part die , too .
what else can say movie,except be plain awful.Tina Louise and Adam West be reason why see this,but,that be it,but their talent be waste junk.I think use double Adam 's scenes,like when be run ca n't see his face.If Adam be embarrass be Zombie Nightmare,just think what must have feel appear ? ? ? be or after,I be notsure,but,still,Zombie Nightmare be classic(check Mystery Science Theater 3000 version first and last)compared this.The gang be very annoy and over-acting actors.A rip-off Wild One star Marlon Brando,of course.Tina look stunning though.I hope and Adam get good paycheck ! ! pass !
grow up ( B. 1965 ) watch and love thunderbird . all my mate school watch . play " thunderbird " school , lunch and school . all want be Virgil or Scott . one want be Alan . count down 5 become art form . take my child see movie hope would get glimpse what love child . how bitterly disappointing . only high point be snappy theme tune . notcould compare original score thunderbird . thankfully early Saturday morning one television channel still play rerun series Gerry Anderson and his wife create . Jonatha Frakes should hand his director chair , his version be completely hopeless . waste film . utter rubbish . CGI remake may be acceptable but replace marionette Homo sapiens subsp . sapiens be huge error judgment .

originally give episode rating two- now wish have think more . also wish have negative rating options.Watching , be amaze how poor whole thing be start finish . adore Ron Pearlman , and John Carpenter ... so what go wrong ? ? last season episode 13 be pull due way handle abortion issue . think season Mr Carpenter manage make something grey-area ca n't immediately see be pro-choice or anti-abortion . be only sit and think realize be very much anti-abortion- get most clearly end when ' Mother ' shoot baby and kill , dismay ' Father ' , who walk off grief , leave mother unharmed . but also see way Ron P. character be treated- hardly think someone have prove enough threat past so as have restraining order would notimmediately be ring police . instead have guard almost sympathetically deal ( only pay end ) do n't mind someone have strong view something , even be n't something agree , but do think its bit lame notstand view , rather try look be sit somewhere middle.But , political issue aside , episode be beyond poor . music be retro-70 's and just plain do n't work . act ( other Ron P. ) be poor . effect be dreadful- might have be well just -not- show monster rather show lame excuse monster had.All this be say , be glad have Masters Horror- do n't mind sit really poor episode find good one . its bit rent horror movie video store- now and again get good one and make worth while . do agree poster that say maybe name need change Masters- people just plain do n't deserve title . ( let stress tho- even tho hate episode , John Carpenter TOTALLY deserve title . be master thru and thru )
could give film real rating , would likely be minus number . respect fact somebody have keep make terrible " horror " film , seriously , people , buy ticket film be waste money could be spend something far more worth your time.Despite be horror film , there be nothing scary , idea see how many horror clich be can fit one movie scare . rating have be high , probably would have make good film long run.Whoever make version " Prom Night " , screw up . actor could probably have do decent job be n't questionable script . be terrible waste cinema trip . will sooner go and see " One Missed Call " again , least have plot .
why horror director want imitate " exorcist " be complete riddle , William Friedkin 's " classic " be very overrate film and , my opinion , notall tense or shocking . and yet here be clean rip-off , Spanish one time , that shamelessly repeat story young girl that get possess pure evil and turn her own family . Paul Naschy ( who must admit look quite hot here ) play honorable priest who get approach John Gibson his sister Leila 's behavior change drastically meet her new boyfriend . first priest do n't believe but when John 's body be discover its neck twist , Leila 's demonic behavior become more noticeable ... " Exorcism " be notonly very unoriginal , be also insufferably boring film ! here Naschy and director Juan Bosch have open opportunity make religiously them exploitation flick full shock and gore , and yet result be tame and overall bloodless drama that will nearly put sleep ! last twenty minute contain atmospheric moment , very stupid , and there be quite lot stylishly film female nudity and sleaze . absolute lack budget be real excuse Paul Naschy already prove before have enough imagination make up shortage money . be just awful film , end story . other European " Excorcist " rip-off be " Antichrist " and " Door " and suck as well !
My commentary have nothing do political sentiment find film . fact , be quite congruent mine . what get be fact term movie , be stupid and devoid semblance story , motive or dialogue . maybe someone should tell Neal substitute lyric song which be fail inspire anyone dwindle audience be n't same thing create character who be motivate speak event create writer or director . silly narrative remain as such iconic legacy Neal Young . most childish scene be one where devil dance his way bar , slip tonic unsuspecting hero , who then find his way dance floor mouth word young song heroine , who be unaware what be take place . somehow two dream scheme where will go up West Coast search ? ? ? ? ? sorry Neal , stick music and leave film make Steven Stills .

Screweyes say dinosaur take ... " Brain-Drain " will let child go . dinosaur instead tear apart evil Screweyes limb limb , give in and agree his term . what ? ! be stupid ! could have just menace , make drop contract , eat then walk off kid . think filmmaker be try show violence be bad , which be moot point when finally dinosaur escape and bunch crow envelop Screweyes and apparently completely eat . oh yeah , that be notviolent ! be back make sense , be notfun , be goofy , be stupid , poorly write and contain big plot hole ever commit film . even kid 's film ... be Bad .
 Gadar be really dumb movie tell fake story.It be too unrealistic and be typical sunny deol movie that be aim bash Pakistan.The movie 's aim be misguide viewer can think Pakistan and 's government be bad but try hide their own flaw wo n't work.And all song and music movie be all bad.Most likely Sikh will love th movie cause be be misguided.The movie suck and suck power . think only Amisha Patel be good movie . i can give 0 out 10 would but low be 1.Please 3 hour your life and do notwatch stupid boring movie .Disaster .
storyline be n't depress enough , movie show cow be butcher graphically slaughterhouse five minute protagonist be narrate her early life butcher . weird stuff . then there be core premise hero/heroine who go and cut his dick off be besot-ten work say would have go be girl . be person psycho , masochist , just doomed queen who take thing too far ? and what sort traumatic childhood do have ? just do n't get adopt and have live out nun who first love and then later hate be unruly . try explain reason do what do , but be really really so hard empathize . such sad and unusual self destruction . be suppose be funny ? what be all about really ?
 Horrible . see many user comment how great show be . truly be Wanna-Be-Friends - make Taiwan knockoff . joke be lame as ... and plot be ridiculous . actor be obviously struggle be funny and be probably cringe when hit awful punchlines ( can call ) . bulk other user who have comment be obviously planet ( or least continent ) . there be obviously reason TV company cancel show ... and none then be when show be do well . make sense ? anyway , steer clear - even be rain and there be absolutely nothing else planet do ... go stand rain instead - more fun .
movie be simply far too long , far too repetitive , male nudity and sexuality being ( be say gay my own collection adult title ) far too gratuitous and unnecessary . much first third movie could have be cut down ten minute and be equally as effective try patience ( and stamina ) audience.I see movie early Saturday afternoon , film festival audience ; type crowd that tend be more adventuresome , interested more experimental or atypical film , such one much dialog , short , foreign film . near sell crowd approximate 275 seat theater start dribble out first half movie and great majority do stay " pay off " ( which never actually arrive ) , have never , about 14 year attend number film festival , experimental , gay and otherwise , see such large number people walk away film.This movie could easily have be cut down more half and be as effective be . also could have go different direction , still short running time , and be far more effective.As currently exist , be notsomething can readily recommend or one would have desire watch again .
do notbe mistake , be neither horror , nor really film . firmly advise watch 82 minute failure ; only reason merit star be presence Chris Pine.Nothing happen . wait patiently hope there may be flicker twist , hint surprise , plot emerge - but no.The character take erratic turn pace their action and yet do n't have time develop - thanks thrifty editor and frankly ashamed writer - return idyllic and playful ( bring teen rock montage ) state . only thing that could have make worse would be add perishable token ethnic ' companion'.Their encounter obstacle ( be human or physical ) be brief , confusing and entirely pointless.Chris Pine fight keep surface be drown misery lightweight cast . Lou Taylor Pucci could n't be dry spend summer Keanu Reaves comb Navada desert.Watch ' The Road ' , watch ' 28 day Later ' , watch day time TV ... anything but ; implore . suffer boredom , may be lead believe film , film be cure .
ca n't stand most reality show and one be bad one Paris Hilton , and sure be his company . but " be fire " or " be hire " , how many season now ? watch show would n't want work guy his ego and all and think watch paint dry have more entertainment valve.I will love hear just one person get up and say " Donald quit and take your money and buy decent hairdo " . see be even try buy fame wrestle WWE . hope get hurt do n't have see his pathetic face anymore . must be sad want fame bad and have talent and make ass try buy . will give show negative mark could but get 1 and do n't deserve .

like watch Mel Gibson Million Dollar Hotel then might enjoy watch Burt Reynolds yet film so bad could never be distribute . can only attest DVD version so maybe VBS version be well quality wise but movie night and dark scene have be so poorly do everythings seem red . first think my DVD player be mess up . be n't . insist watch recommend adjust color your TV be black and white . do n't will never be able get film . do will simply remind poor film student attempt revist style Pulp Fiction .
try . really do . think maybe , give Joao Pedro Rodrigues chance , could enjoy his movie . know see O FANTASMA feel ill and nearly disgust core , but review be quite good and favor , so be , " what hell . least do n't pay 10 dollar Quad . give shot."Sometimes be good go your dentist and ask root canal previous anesthetic alleviate horror so much pain . often wonder would n't be good go back my childhood and demand my former bully really let have . other occasion , often think world be really flat and sail away far enough , will notonly get away , but fall clear over , and evil , Lovecraftian thing will snatch its 9000 tentacle and squeeze life -- and French fry 1995 , still linger my esophagus -- out me.Is there reason Odete ? will say not... just maybe her creator think write story center her madness ( one that make Alex Forrest look Strawberry Shortcake ) look notonly creepy , but flat-out sick bone . first decide leave her present boyfriend ( shriek hysteric ) want child and believe be too young . later crash funeral gay man , and -- get -- order get closer , feign be pregnant insinuate life dead man 's mother and lover sick way . oh , course , shriek banshee and throw notone , but good three time his grave . and there be ridiculous business progressively become " Pedro " which sum up weak-as-bad-tea explanation love know gender . or something.I will say be nut can cashew , unsalted . but then again , so be director . and , take chance . least man look good . other ... notmuch else see here .
seemingly endless movie that really deserve zero rating . premise seem simple enough : Yentl , girl interested study Talmud , want go school . but only boy be allow study , so her father 's death decide disguise boy get . do and become close friend Avigdor , who be be marry beautiful woman name Hadass . Hadass ' family learn Avigdor 's brother committed suicide , and wedding be call off . Yentl , now call Anschel , be then select marry Hadass . do but be never consummate . Yentl/Anschel and Avigdor go away few day , and Yentl/Anschel reveal her secret . movie end Avigdor return ( and marry ? ) Hadass , and Yentl go America continue her study will have continue do so disguise.The plot above seem interesting first movie 2 hour long , but there be several thing that ruin . starter , there be constant singing . ( can already hear critic shouting . ) Yes , know be musical there be suppose be lot song and dance number . but movie could have be improve be direct and play . song become tedious while , and there be n't much dancing one would expect . many song be forgettable , real memorable lyric , and significance could easily have be substitute voice-over . only one song stand out rest , " Papa Can Hear Me " . be obvious most other be deliberately place Streisand could simply have reason show off her vocal ability five ten minute . chance be anyone who will see film will already know what superb singer and actress be , so song really be n't necessary.Second , Streisand 's makeup , which can be see her scene man ( lipstick , enhanced lash , and trace blush be all obvious ) make hard audience believe Yentl/Anschel character , be actually serious , and fool her new friend , colleague , and even Hadass , believe be man . yet be ask and expect believe very thing . there seem be contradiction , her character talk , or rather sing , how do n't think can pull off , but be surprise everyone seem be fool be wear man 's clothing . mean be then expect believe other character be so naive ca n't see other difference , such her action , which be clear giveaway . facial difference alone can be include , other character film mention their male relative or friend do n't have beard or other facial hair . nevertheless , 1900s , woman dress man , but wear much makeup Streisand 's character do , and still try pass off man solely wear man 's clothing , would have be deem unacceptable and cause outrage . chance be would probably be force leave town , or even country . therefore " feminine " makeup Streisand do notlend character 's credibility , and only weaken plot . be only apply make Streisand look more beautiful , should have be scrapped.Thirdly , when Yentl/Anschel reveal who truly be end , be then ask believe other character be notas smart Streisand 's and only when learn " truth " do become little wise . now become more and more apparent whole plot be so far fetch be nothing more custom-made vehicle Streisand fuel.Lastly , there be who be fan Streisand who will find fault film , its plot , or song . must respectfully disagree . have excellent vocal and acting ability , be not" fan " her style singing . however , have enjoy many her other feature include musical . there be even song like , so be not" hater " nor have set out bash . have write review honest perspective , someone who have try their good watch movie - several time even - and have note problem . Streisand be interested create great or even believable film , could have do so here notinject her need show off and prove how talented , beautiful and smart be nearly turn . movie do nothing more hurt her ability , make appear self-absorbed , and thus turn film laugh-fest unworthy her fan or audience .
could n't wait see movie . way movie , could n't wait end . ( white ) actor be deliver their line Woody Allen have just say , " say ... " then say their line screen be try imitate Woody Allen . be so annoy . all know how Will Ferrell really talk , and do n't stumble over his word Mr. Allen . comedy portion film be just as boring tragedy and definitely never funny or even entertaining . must admit have never be major Woody Allen fan , and movie definitely have notconvert . think his writing be just as bad his direction . movie will go down one bad 10 movie have ever see .

Deep Shock be really crap , big shame consider fact look pretty high budget .
absolutely adore the ' Toxic Avenger ' series , but weak offering Troma people do n't make sense , and have yawn all time.A leak nuclear plant ( and grow weed next ) make youngster Tromaville High go nut , which cause join gang , have sex , explode , and whatever . also there be sort monster breeding high school ... my God , movie be mess.The actor pretty much stop their effort one and should . ( intended ) overact start get my nerve about 5 minute ... Disappointing . negative .
This be absolutely bad trash have ever see . when see theater ( arghhh ! ) , take 15 full minute realize what be see be feature , notsick joke !
high rating give film IMDB user , be nothing more your typical girl-with-a-bad-childhood-obsessively-stalks-married-man film . attractive Justine Priestly 's brief nude scene may attract voyeur , but film be hackney tripe.* 1/2 ****

Charo performing lipo ? Charles Grodin assist hip replacement ? C'mon ... show little respect . even citizen Muncie be out program as stage . Police Academy = High School Gym ? Poor edit ( how many time can use car-to-car shot Taco Bell background ? ) , cheesy siren effect ( same loop add ad nauseum ' call ' roll code or not) , and last , but notleast -- more officer safety issue could shake stick at.If want see manufacture police work and wise-ass fake cop , would watch Reno 911 .
First off , really love Henry Fool , which put very small pool movie goer . Parker Posey be one good actress on-screen today . but film be full-out travesty . watch Hartley and actor talk film extra - so full pride , and make pointless analogy Star Wars - be stomach-turning . be hype producer part ( HDNET ) realize max . true example Emperor and his new clothes . mostly feel Hal have spoil Henry FOOL forever . do n't think can ever see again be pure , innocent light.Remember Hal , can fool people some time ... etc. director would be nowhere today do be churn meaningless garbage . sadly , be pure example lesson teach film adaptation . story must be exciting and active , or its box-office hope be dim indeed . never mind decent story . actor , be try act straitjacket.The score , believe Hartley 's , be tasteless . drum hit walk all dialog . there be one Apple Soundtrack loop recognize that give smile.When see trailer , think , oh , be just try grab new audience . but be really ridiculous ride . will be happy spoil movie , but have be do . be rotten . FOOL franchise be dead . long live Henry Fool .

Al could n't run his farm good could run country . be lose money operation do n't care farm when could make more $ on speaking tour . only global warming that be unchallenged be hot air produce gasbag !
Bah . tired , desultory rework out copyright work never design be filmed.On plus side , Toni Collette be superb as always ( be actual actress , see ) , and there be nicely handle handover cut scene . there be even few genuinely funny line , and filmwork , score and edit be competent , apart bizarre lapse voiceover and speak camera conclusion.But , ah , but . much cast seem be autopilot , and be almost all very clearly too old ( and one case too young ) their declare age . worse , be all speak " Austinese " , peculiar falsetto self satisfied sing song that could n't be further way people actually speak Austen 's day ( think Yosemite Sam , kid not) . be particularly sad , consider seem finally be see demise equally farcial " Fakespearan " Olivier and his crony be so fond bellow top their lungs.And bad be Gwyneth Paltrow . be only ever play one character her film , and stay true form here , run her entire range ( smirk sulk ) first ten minute , then just repeat rest overlong film . there be absolutely chemistry and her admirer , nor apparent reason why would be interested her apart.In short , there be very little reason watch Emma . be amiable enough adaptation , but be go pack film full anacronisms ( i.e. appalingly thin lead who ca n't shoot bow or handle period accent ) then might as well do properly , as vastly superior " clueless " .
 Utterly predictable silly show man who have kill his wife mow down when driving and claim have black out . why be still drive car ? why do still feel able drive car have kill his wife one ? question have notoccur writer . story then witters psychologist and her fail marriage which be tie fail marriage wife-killing blackout driver . omniscient mother and one dimensional child be throw good measure , and whole build up predictable denouement and crash finale . be police psychologist so easily take ? Deadful writing actor do their good , but be doom failure . be par Harlequin Romance . do n't waste your time watch one that be what be aim .
hyp violence and have be brand as sick . well , violence be good bit be afraid , but unfortunately character be notdevelop enough allow understand why go their ( entirely predictable ) rampage . film have truly dreadful script . never get chance get know Robert and his action end be just plain pathetic . acting be n't much good , either , bad be TV chef and school teacher . direction be clumsy , pace enough send sleep . and what earth be school film project all about ? comment film perhaps ? use newsreel climactic murder be laughable . guy obviously think be intellectual but be hopelessly out their depth . how earth get great Yorgos Arvanitis light will never know . and how get money make first place be even great mystery . absolutely awful comprehension .
 Weak plot , predictable violence , only semi interesting character . writer ( also one star ? ) be fictionalize his own screw up and add incredulous fantasy drug and murder make " hot " . predictable rap and house soundtrack , family conflict , be poorly act , stereotypical , and ultimately terribly boring . even title have be do - IMDb list FIVE movie same name release 2007-2008 ! !Note : see Showtime , which list synopsis one other movie . be halfway thru realize one be undercover cop . even tho stereotype , would have make interesting happen .
look forward see movie when come out , be huge SNL fan . when my boyfriend and go see , people come out early show be yell , " do n't waste your money ! " but course have find out ourselves.While there be few funny bit ( Laser Bra 2000 , Root Boy Slim ) , most feel could have be severely edit down amusing 1 hour show . be pretty bad.When opera singer come , many people get up and walk out . make laugh , realize O'Donoghue be just press people 's button purpose movie . or else be just insane . whatever - do n't need waste your time watch , be that bad .
have n't be able decide movie be so bad be good , or , quote Enid Coleslaw , " so bad be go good and back bad again . " matter , force look much same way pile weird coloured vomit might , and offer up number scene wo n't forget even want . there be sneering young Ray Liotta tell pigtailed Pia her creative writing trophy look penis . bit later , there be Ray again , molest Pia , notappropriately shape trophy but garden hose . there be firm chin Pia tell her domineer Mom want go bed Ray 's geezer father , Walter . there be actress graveyard scene yowl good line ever write Pia or anyone else : " WWWWHHHYYYYYYY !

" see have already spend more time comment " Lonely Lady " have far good picture , so will quit . be forewarn , though , once start watch probably wo n't be able take your eye screen two hour your life have vanish forever .
see film London Premiere , and have say - do n't expect much , but do expect something that be least mildly entertaining.The original " basic instinct " be great film and be still something " smut classic " but be entertaining . can recall countless time flip channel TV late Friday or Saturday night have come movie and find begin actually pay attention it.However , lame-brain , waaay-belated sequel have nothing . be Sharon Stone still gorgeous ? well , let be put way -- 47-year-old , be pretty hot . be as beautiful be original ? No. also have clearly have plastic surgery her face , and her haircut movie be somewhat unappealing . do n't look soft or genuine or innocent do original -- which be sort whole point be evil seductress , and whatnot.The rest performance range bad terrible -- and Michael Caton-Jones ( typically safe director -- one who do n't always do great work but manage make worthwhile movie ) have officially deliver his first true turkey ; movie bad people be laugh certain moment that be intend be serious.I hear film go multiple edit session , and be very clear start . nothing make much sense . whole plot be cosmic mess and end -- oh my ! talk about stupid and unbelievable . ( still predictable , though . ) see " Gigli , " see " Son Mask " -- and be notlook " smear " film , can say my own authority ( which do n't have agree , mind ) prefer both film catastrophic failure.By way , Stone leave five minute movie begin and people theater begin throw thing screen particularly outrageous and insulting scene orgy-type nightclub."Basic instinct 2 " -- basically , stink , too .
avid fan Cary Grant , expect watch movie and howl laughter , AMC bill comedy . have never be more disappoint film ! Cary 's usual charm and effortless comedy be AWOL entire movie ; come as strained , bored , and just not. Mississip 's character rank one bad stereotype have ever witness - his accent be terribly exaggerated ( and incorrect , accord which part Mississippi claim hail ) , and whenever do deliver line , be several decibel high other cast member . Mississip try make stand out film lovable , country-bumpkin goofball , but end , manage only detract already weak plot . Mansfield look more obscene blow-up doll Hollywood sex kitten , and be never know Hollywood her acting ability , film scream never have ability begin . Ray Walston 's character be sugary and ultimately contrived . four man shore leave , be tame leave have ever see . watch nightmare its very end , and wo n't spoil anyone , will tell be most absurd will ever see . film try spark patriotism and sense debt fight man , but film miss point totally its weak plot line and weak cast . sorry , Cary !

OK , notpossibly , honestly bad movie i have ever seen.this make absolutely sense , there be plot , characterization , acting , just nothing.here be what i think when i first see may 28th , 2003 **caution , be spoiler alert . be also alot complain about how bad movie is::ok movie begin and character be introduce , but there be character explanation . as far i know main character be new school , but apparently not. also appear live ... then be foster kid ... then his mother be rage alcoholic who live still . also all his friend apparently have parent and live themselves.now come main plot point , insane guy have break out insane asylum and be run rampant . now our main character be obsess guy and focus ' intently contingency movie . i think i must have miss main plot element here , there be Reason main character get hooked . even be point , have reason , why do all his friend , who be skeptical 5 minute before , suddenly follow and do what wants.so movie continue , and get right . be run havoc school , blah blah blah . but wait minute ... suddenly everyone know main character be run ' show ' here . wait second , do n't insane guy specifically tell main character notdo ? be suppose be anynomous.ah important plot element have be skip over ... insane guy be suppose notbe insane ... everyone say be n't insane . but story go , be VERY CLEARLY Out HIS MIND . but i think news people say be n't ... hm ... now movie come close . WAS THE Close ? what HELL WAS THAT ? notonly do ending notanswer question main character , do n't answer question insane guy . be people same situation ? yes , then there be very basic story line that do nottend . no then what be point say " be two week . " ? ?*end thing ... *that be what i think then . be pretty much what i still think now . be 6 month line , and i can get free , i might give chance , but i doubt . i highly doubt .

Kim Basinger be great actress but be definitely slum when take role . movie be bad one reason particular : lapse logic . its look one movie that would have be passable all its plot hole have come out 80s and 90s but 2008 just look real stupid . be bad thriller have ever see and have see Bone Collector and Twisted.The story detail Della(Kim Basinger)is just get buy gift mall be harass gang thug that end up kill cop that come her aid . then be chase idiotic goon abandon street and get rid one one toolbox full tools.So many thing be wrong movie . say movie leap logic turn and exception Kim Basinger , acting be made-for-TV bad . hell , pseudo thriller be made-for-TV bad . way kill politically correct thugs(1 Caucasian , 1 Hispanic , 1 Asian and 1 African American come together stalk Caucasian woman . do n't just love America ? )is laughable fault . way kill Hispanic guy make laugh hysterically . sex scene main hoodlum be so out leave field make shake your head shame . only recommend lover bad film and one else . anybody else especially Kim Basinger fan would do well notown flick . do n't want see actress respect film bad now do ? course not. be warn .
The Gospel Lou be major disappointment . have receive E-mail theater show be great and inspirational movie . be neither great nor inspirational . cinematography be pretty iffy whole movie . lot scene be flash back that be do way that could n't tell time what be about . voice be often distort reason . also many people movie be far fetch . relationship have his ex & son be never make clear . also whole movie have most one way , and then all sudden BAM , be cure and inspiring people . whole movie seem show boxing be one thing that be bad his life , make live his life way be live , but when change , do n't leave box , teach other how box . thumb .
when go and see movie , have great expectation . but have so wrong . movie be exactly other horror movie . be virus , zombie etc. exactly Resident Evil and many , many other movie . but difference , and other movie , be story be very week . be bad actor and boring music . photo be OK but rest be total crap . do n't see " horror " movie , go and see Ring 2 or other movie who be much more story . hope will stop make horror movie who have virus and virus spread and make people zombie . have see enough . only good thing movie be when be stand roof and shoot famous , infected celebrity .

 Quite simply should n't have be make . be predictable and clichd . screen chemistry which make first " My Girl " so captivating be nowhere be find here , and acting whole be stilt and force . writing also leave much be desire , ' memorable ' line such " earpeircing barbaric custom " be just shocking . where " My Girl " provoke genuine feeling sadness and genuinely funny moment , so many sequel " my Girl 2 " try recreate emotion generate audience , and fail miserably . maybe i be be hard film because how great first one be , but quite honestly insult quality original sort drivel installment serve up . surely have come close " Son mask " be one bad sequel time . case , old say ring true ; " ai n't broke , do n't fix " .
movie have long , most torture and agonize end movie have see long time . unfortunately start right opening credit . January Jones give such wooden performance , be surprise do n't go up flame when get candle film . do n't really remember other film be do ( blessing have believe . never criticize actor performance film there be too many thing which can affect but case,it be so bad actually stand out atrocious script . grant have give line and situation Meryl Streep would have trouble but swear time shes read cue card set . other time think might actually be learn disabled or slow way .

movie be notonly poorly script and direct but be simply distasteful . beautiful novel be terribly misrepresent film . many change have be make storyline , presumably streamline timeframe . but what result be simply confusing . acting ca n't possibly overcome script which remove character ' motive their behavior . plus , conversion English do notwork when everyone refer patriarch Esteban Esteban . horrible . please please please read gorgeous novel , Spanish possible . do N'T See This Film . will ruin what could be wonderful experience .

" will give credit where be due- closing scene be clever and amusing , be still awake .
complete mess movie be direct Bill Rebane , man partly responsible truly infamous anti-classic Monster a-Go Go . be near end Cold come unbelievable conclusion film be fact even bad 60 's shocker . story such be be about three eccentric millionaire who invite group people their remote mansion play series macabre game . whoever manage last pace and survive end will win $1,000,000 . be very simple plot but Rebane still somehow manage make proceeding verge incomprehensible . thing happen . character be completely forget about . nothing make too much sense . and then end . weirdly . mean what hell be end all about exactly ? guess be leave draw your own conclusion . production value and acting be question pornographic movie standard . truth Pamela Rohleder ( Shelly ) be n't even good . be so unbelievably terrible be compelling . sadly same thing can be say crap-fest whole , be just bargain basement rotter .

Lastly,never mind Aditya Chopra , who past have produce and direct good film such " Mohabbatein , " what be Yash Chopra do produce such trash movie ? conclusion : bad movie , notworth waste your time and be my first and last impression .

This be truly terrible : painfully irritate stylise performer screech and mug gratingly incoherent dialogue which take place scene which seem have purpose , beginning , middle or end , cut together apparent narrative or even cognitive intention , all service entirely uninteresting and almost undetectable " story " . what make bad be film 's pretention " style " : suddenly remote-head crane shoot spiral downwards , and , apparent reason there be sudden whip-pans or wobblyhand-held section : all " style " merely serve magnify almost unbelievably huge misconception project and almost offensive vacuity material . definitely candidate bad film ever make .

Tony Scott have never be very good director , but film be make " Crimson Tide " seem bring one step close be inarguable bad working today ( Michael Bay may fall same category , but least his big , dumb , delusional epic entertain primally perverse level ) . and other overblown Hollywood biopics ( " De-Lovely " and " confession dangerous mind , " instance ) chronicle life pretentious , overrate , or outright shallow cipher give aura " mystique " society that thrive juicy behind-the-scenes detail , " Domino " be film that begin little potential , and dash infinitesimal amount sixty-minute mark . already-distended run time 128 minute , film feel twice as long , and spend time character obnoxiously superficial and forgettable ( superior " Rules Attraction , " Scott 's attempt tinge proceeding irony Domino 's smug , self-aware-rich-girl voice-over only draw attention film 's sledgehammer cluelessness ) become act only masochist could find pleasurable . story ? Spoiled-upper-crust-babe Domino Harvey ( Keira Knightley , ersatz-badass performance shallow her gorgeous look ) be sick shallow lifestyle rich and famous Los Angeles , and accost gruff bounty hunter Mickey Rourke and Edgar Ramirez learn more exciting trade ; way , there be double-cross , shootout , medium attention ( courtesy tongue-in-cheek Christopher Walken , phone his trademark sleazebag ) , and laughable hint romance .

Slaughter High be intrinsically your emblematic 80s slasher flick . prank go out hand leave geeky guy horribly burn . few year later geeky guy return and start kill people who hurt . now story might sound intriguing and very entertaining , but what make horrible film so different rest 80s slasher flick be have humorless flaw and continuation errors.The acting be horrendous , however , actually notas bad one would suspect . do n't help character film be so grody and unlikable . lead , Carol Manning ( Caroline Munro ) be easily big tormentor all and be one be ostensibly suppose share compassion and root . notmention , geeky guy be almost too geeky and think even stereotypical geek would be rudely madden and just downright antagonize how geeky his , so when get maul , do anyone really care ? there be much unintentional laughter potential . Munro 's lack act talent be quite apparent , which put down same level rest awful cast . however , most amusement be easily when film poorly attempt pose Munro , who be her mid 30s time , teenager cast teenager . and then when come late life and Munro be play around her real age , rest cast do notpass adult . all go well theme song that be hilariously pose heavy metal thrash accompany maniacal laughter and voice shriek " will get . " that be say , Slaughter High really be n't very good slasher flick , but do have bad cheesy entertainment value . perhaps essential hardcore slasher fan , but do n't expect dilemma , suspense , or credibility . horrible ! ! !

Amisha Patel be hand down dead sexy amazing body i would love bone . but even could n't save film be disaster . instead wear sexy clothes usually do , movie do n't . maybe cos be play Muslim , but do n't act one movie . overall , be poor show all way , be sure will appeal people , who love see Bollywood actor beat up 100 guy . give break .
actually prefer Robin Williams his more serious role ( e.g. Good Will Hunting , Fisher King , World accord Garp ) . be my favorite Robin Williams movie . but Seize day , well-act , be one bad movie have ever see and certainly bad Robin Williams movie ( even bad death Smoochy , Club Paradise , and Alladin Ice).Every good story be go have its up and down . movie , however , be one giant down . do n't need feel-good Hollywood cheese-fest , but have get have something other 90 minute complete and utter hopelessness . movie remind " Love Liza " ( which be actually bad ) seem only point movie be see how far one person can fall . answer ? who care .

trouble book , " Memoirs Geisha " be have Japanese surface but surface be all American man 's way thinking . read book be watch magnificent ballet great music , set , and costume yet perform barnyard animal dress costumesso far Japanese way thinking be characters.The movie be n't Japan or real geisha . be story few American man 's mistaken idea Japan and geisha filter their own ignorance and misconception . so what be movie be n't Japan or geisha ? be pure fantasy so many people have say ? yes , but then why make American fantasy ? there be so many miss opportunity . imagine culture where there be puritanical hang-up , connotation sin sex . sex be natural and normal . how be sex handle movie ? right . be dirty . close thing sex scene movie have Sayuri wrinkle up her nose and grimace distaste five second as man try mount have drop handful cockroach her crotch.Does anyone actually enjoy sex movie ? Nope .

Nope . lie there like cold slab meat chopping block . course be n't suppose enjoy . and be what mean movie . why could n't have give her something enjoy ? why do all sex have be sinful and wrong ? Mameha Chairman be Sayuri 's secret patron , and as such be auction her virginity . could have rig auction and win . Nobu do n't even bid . so why do Chairman let old codger win and , reek old-man stink , get his finger all her naked body ? would woman ever really forgive man ? let be try make sense . be Mameha Chairman incur debt Sayuri 's geisha training . order recoup his debt chairman have Sayuri sell Dr. Crab . Mameha Chairman sell Sayuri 's sexual favors old geezer so Chairman could make money out . Chairman be n't her patron . be her pimp ! romantic love story.Yes , film be gorgeous but be beauty very attractive , alluring transvestite whose voice , appearance and touch be thrill . but very feminine surface lie ominous secret . incorrectly appear Japanese surface film lurk ominous secret heart , soul , spirit and core film be entirely American and male . notgood thing be be try be other lie , distortion , and terribly wrong.Some contrast Japan and MOAG:Japanese style Refined , elegant simplicity . Moag style Peking Opera.Japanese geisha Hair sweep up . Moag geisha Loose hair which surely must have get gunked up thick paste white makeup.Japanese shave ice - Japanese be rather strict seasonal observance . shave ice be strictly summer treat . Moag shave ice - Chairman buy Chiyo , young Sayuri play marvelous Suzuka Ohgo , treat cherry-blossom-viewing season . thought make my entire body shiver cold.Japanese geisha trained and skilled entertainer . MOAG geisha - sluts.Japanese wind chime - used summer hear sound make , thanks breeze , Japanese people feel somehow cool . Moag wind chime - door bell ! person stand front be house and make noise wind chime would be consider lunatic , notgain entrance.Japan emphasis human relationship , group orient . Moag " want life that be mine " American individualism.Japanese traditional dance refined elegance . almost geometrical and mechanical precision . Moag dance Martha Graham freak out LSD wear not-very-auspicious white Japanese funeral shroud . perform geisha ramp place that look strip club ? Ha ha ha ! be strip club where do most their research geisha ? Japan house fire Setting or even let fire break out be bad murder pose such dire threat community . fire can rip wooden village , town , and city destroy hundred or thousand home and kill many people . Moag house fire - great adjunct fight scene but there be zero ramification and be no longer need out-of-control fire miraculously put out . technically movie end here very least Sayuri would have be ostracize and join her sister never hear again . which be where Arthur Golden and Rob Marshall should be exiled.Enough . movie stink .

Okey , there where bucket blood , but do n't even look real . slaughter and violence remind more Braindead Hostel or Saw-movies . and Braindead be fun ! Okey , laugh Live Feed couple time , but that be more disappointment out sheer fun ! so instead waste 80 minute watch Live Feed , watch anything else !
have always be great fan Woody Allen and always will be most what do past , but only blind lover could ignore how dull , meaningless , pretentious and most horrendously act movie be . vacuous mental masturbation base inconsistent ground . and what disastrous idea artificially recreate presumed " actor Allen-clone " , that be put Will Farrell 's mouth and gesture what Allen would have do Farrell 's place have be 30 year young . outcome be obviously ludicrous . and notspeak dialogue ... what be intend be philosophical reflection turn involuntary mockery intellectual ponder , unaware its comic effect . how sad ...

shadow doubt mysterious planet be one bad movie ever make , yet retain affection my heart poverty its special effect and astoundingly awful sound track first 15 minute ( and be honest be need see ) combine create something that be hilariously side-splitting.The opening scene in ' space ' be just about as unfathomable cinematography get , washing-up liquid bottle whiz your eye muffle dialogue . have have time work out be who be go mad , credit roll and action struggle life.And aside double-headed plasticine giant snail that terrorise our hero , also get added double bonus have both original actor voice and dub voice same time . pure genius.The sad thing fan kind fare be have only ever see one copy , so chance ever see be highly unlikely . perhaps own only copy existence .
 *Sigh* leave Finn take stupid idea , blow out proportion and try market cool .

Madonna , actress , certainly be NOT.If rend original film 1979 , though , will enjoy , and actor can actually act . negative .
remember when piece trash come out , all newspaper be squawk about how have take Barbra Streisand year get film make . well could n't have take many year ; play only open 1975 , eight year previously . make Broadway star great actress Tovah Feldshuh , who probably should have be cast film , but Nooooo ... Great Star Barbra Had To do Her Way . and WITH Music No LESS ! film be total disaster start finish . one thing , Barbra be FORTY YEARS Old when make and look minute . there be way anyone could possibly swallow young girl yearning study Torah . and then when dress up boy get campy . get impression Streisand could notbear be unattractive play around make-up ; be pretty boy be as girl . and be notbad enough , get involve both her schoolmate Avigdor ( Mandy Patinkin , whose good moment be shot his naked rear end ) and his fiance ( Amy Irving , who do her usual sleepwalker routine , bit schtick poor woman always resort when director ignore and do notknow what be do ) . Yentl even go so far as marry girl ; wo n't even bother mention " wedding night " scene.Then there be music . Nine totally forgettable song , all sing Streisand voice-over ( presumably look her mind ) , and one intrusive and irritate fingernail blackboard.I wo n't say Streisand do notshow glimmer promise director here ; visual be lovely ( Patinkin 's backside especially ) , and have good eye balance . problem movie be wo n't get out her own way . do notbelieve one second title role ; should Never have add song , and top that whole mess go two hour and fifteen minute . be sick whole sorry mess forty-five minutes.Awful , awful , awful .
not only do film 's author , Steven Greenstreet , obviously idolize Michael Moore , but also follow his footstep use several Moore 's Propaganda film-making tactic .

Greenstreet 's assumption American audience would be interested film due promote religious and conservative angle do n't seem be well founded.Even name film , Divided State , be somewhat misnomer Utah vote overwhelmingly Bush 's re-election and thus appear be more politically unify other state . division movie title seem more indicative gulf that exist Greenstreet 's ideological difference his religion and state . anything , find humorous correlation religious angle suppose documentary and Woody Allen 's hilarious contention Sleeper ( 1973 ) , " be beat up Quaker " .

This may notbe very bad movie Peter Sellers ever do ( think laurel go " Prisoner Zenda " ) but be surely most depressing . seller , especially makeup Nayland Smith , look have just undergo chemotherapy . Fu Manchu , look hardly good and spend most film ( exception strangely disturbing scene where get jolt electrical current ) verge collapse weight all makeup . support player also look tired and run down , and Sid Caeser 's presence be offensive even his constant reference " Chinks ! " ( One bright spot : would be one last time major motion picture would portray Asian so insultingly ... or , matter , star non-Asian one ! ) . film seem surprisingly cheap , soupy photography and drab set - even whiz-bang Elvis number end look cut-rate . only stunning Helen Mirren and tall , thin , nervous guy who get his pant wet add spark life sad affair . , film provide eerie premonition great comic 's death , and even eerie documentation his die .
have see four other Japanese horror film and be n't too impressive . however , could sense there be sensible script guide way.Not here , way . be about detective who be try tie together similar murder that have be happen . when find suspect question , suspect freak out keep see ghost . then , ghost start follow detective around Reason THAT be Never EXPLAINED and Takes More Than Half MOVIE.Bad enough ? oh no . film keep switch perspective different character who do n't have much do story . have see other movie where show different perspective . notcase here.Also , whatever be happen screen that be actually tolerable quickly end . example , there few scene slight instrumental score that build up and ... then just cut scene . be aware can be dramatic effect . be definitely notintention here . be just bad editing.Finally , there be " ghost " who just scream way that be notscary or unintentionally funny . be annoy and happen lot movie.All scare have be do before good way can see all come . then one , movie be over . point , wave confusion sweep audience could sense all feel have waste our time . someone do mock clap and laughter ensue . be well whole film . simply put , AVOID .
well , writing be very sloppy , directing be sloppy , and edit make bad ( least i hope be edit ) . act be n't bad , but be n't good either . pretty much none character be likable . least 45 minute movie be waste time and other hour or so be notuse anywhere its full potential . be great idea , but yet waste good idea go . could have end 3 different place but just keep go mostly predictable hollywood ending . and what be n't predictable be do so badly do n't matter . end be notworth watching . sandra bullock be out her element and should stay away type movie . movie look rush also . movie just be n't really worth see , and have i pay i would have be very mad . maybe i be more disappoint i expect really good movie and get bad one . movie be nothorrifibly bad , but i would n't reccomend . i give 2 10 b/c i like idea much and i do one character ( Justin i believe , super smart one ) . and also have very cheap way cover plot hole . be try cover volcano cheap mask tape , be notpretty . anyway , see , wait $1.50 theater or video , like pretty much movie see , then i guess will like one .
First , yes , animal have emotion . do n't know already , then believe be moron . but let be assume none be moron . all know animal have emotion , and now want see how emotion be manifest nature , correct ? what get instead be tedious and ridiculously simplistic documentary that attempt show how animal be " human " . filmmaker search high & low footage animal engage human-like behaviour , and when happen say , " monkey be almost human ! " ( that be actually direct quote).Everything be human term . waste time theorize what make dog " smile " , but notonce do mention what wag tail mean . arrogance researcher be disgusting . even go so far as show chimpanzee dress human clothing and wear cowboy hat.I have be expect insightful documentary animal their own term . want learn how animal emote their own language . but instead , researcher keep fall back pedantic , anthropomorphic observation and assumption . add cheezy soundtrack and image chimp " celebrate Christmas " , and be enough turn my stomach.But do n't end there . half documentary be film notwild but laboratory and experimental facility . all camera shot chimp be steel bar , and see how monkey be crowd together their sterile concrete cage . One particularly sobering moment happen beginning ( have be quick notice ) where captive monkey say sign language , " Want out . hurry go."Obscure reference be make " stress test " and psychological experiment which shudder imagine . baby monkey be separate their mother birth and be give wireframe doll order prove baby monkey crave " mother figure " . and 40 year experiment , smug researcher pat back reach their brilliant conclusion : monkey have emotions.One chimp name " Washoe " have be concrete cage 1966 purpose , and day remain thus . get brief glimpse ( again bar ) her leaning concrete wall rather lackluster expression . personally , do n't need see further experimental datum . Washoe , apologize our entire specie .

The Robin Cook novel " Coma " have already be turn pretty successful movie 1978 . couple year later be turn Robin Cook bestseller get big screen treatment , but case " Sphinx " virtually everything that could go wrong do go wrong . be dreadful adventure flick consist wooden performance , stupid dialogue , unconvincing character and leaden pace . only reason escape 1-out-of-10 rating be Egyptian backdrop provide infinitely more fascination story . hard believe Franklin J. Schaffner ( " Patton " and " planet Apes " ) be director debacle.Pretty Egyptologist Erica Baron ( Lesley Anne-Down ) be work vacation Cairo when stumble shop antique dealer Abdu-Hamdi ( John Gielgud ) . Hamdi befriend Erica and be impress her enthusiasm and knowledge . consequently , show beautiful and incredibly rare statue Pharoah Seti be keep secretly his shop . very existence statue arouse intense excitement Erica , could provide vital clue locate Seti I 's long-lost tomb , prize great discovery Tutankhamun 's tomb 1922 . Hamdi can tell Erica more be brutally murder his shop , Erica watch silent terror meet his grisly end . afraid yet tantalise what have see , Erica attempt track down treasure . find help and hinder her quest various other party , none whom be truly trustworthy . there be Yvon ( Maurice Ronet ) , seemingly friend but perhaps man sinister ulterior motive ? then there be Akmed Khazzan ( Frank Langella ) , Egyptian whom Erica feel certain attraction but who may also be hide dangerous secret her.The big problem " Sphinx " generally result its total disregard plausibility . down could n't be less convincing female Egyptologist assume would be quite well-educated and resourceful , yet spend entire film scream helplessly busty bimbo teen slasher flick . rare occasion actually be n't run potential villain , do other brainless thing such take Polaroid flash photo 4,000 year old tomb ! plot twist be heavy-handed say least , mainly comprise revelation and double-cross that can be predict well advance . ca n't even try enjoy film level dumb but entertaining action fare , pace be awfully sluggish . what little action can be find be separate long stretch tedium . famous review movie declare : " sphinx stink ! " never before have 2-hour film be so aptly sum up 2 word .
see movie last night and really want like . my expectation movie have be go up and down ever hear be be make . day will see something spectacular and day will be disappointed.Yet be kind fan be , have high hope movie but end be sorely disappointed.While love Richard Donner movie do n't like their sometimes campy nature or change make Superman 's character and his powers.Singer however choose take bad element Donner movie and put his version.While his Lex Luthor be slightly dark be still nothing more shyster , conman and common criminal . be no more intelligent when Gene Hackman play . Kevin spacey do his good play Luthor well but ultimately fall victim shoddy writing and unremarkable dialog.His henchman be more two dimensional even comic book henchman . most literally have dialog movie.****SPOILERS AHEAD**** Kitty Kowalski be almost exactly same character Ms. Tesmacher . seem be as evil and cold Lex Luthor but prove be just underling who melt see Superman trouble and quite predictably betray Luthor.The big disappointment movie be Frank Langella Perry White . be n't huge fan top Perry White Donner movie but least have soul . be say and do , veteran reporter who care truth and good story . Langella 's Perry White be nothing but corporate stooge . want everyone concentrate Superman related story sell paper even other paper be do same thing . do n't care real story , real mystery black out and what Lex Luthor be up now be out prison.The bad thing Langella be be dull ! actor can be quiet and sober and yet have undercurrent that let know still water run deep . Frank Langella be puddle.Brandon Routh be notbad actor . be OK but again there be notsingle memorable line whole movie . notactor 's fault . his movement be clearly mean look graceful , even slight movement his finger effect way fly . but still look choreograph and artificial.Lois Lane badly write be surprisingly well act Kate Bosworth . unfortunately , again , Pulitzer Prize win journalist and writer , be about as eloquent teenage Dawson 's Creek.James Marsden be my favorite actor whole movie , mostly look more Superman even Routh . superpower manage figure out Lois Lane 's message , fly plane location , get board Luthor 's yacht and rescue Lois and her son.The only move moment movie be when be all trap pantry be flood water and ship be sink . see slowly going be immerse water . know Superman be go come last moment rescue but still ca n't help but feel sorry them.As say plot be very haphazard . Singer have say , be notmovie superhero return and try find his place world . as soon return world welcome back open arm . Lois be only one who be nothappy see back . even Luthor be happy have Superman back give chance settle score man steel.Superman be show be probably one dumb hero universe . big green piece meteorite be steal museum , Lex Luthor be out prison , now have knowledge Superman 's power and weakness , and yet be still notable connect dot enough know Luthor would be use kryptonite him.According movie only thing Superman be good be lift really , really heavy thing . action sequence be all incredibly predictable .
Man , what scam turn out be ! notbe n't good ( be n't really expect anything ) but be mislead DVD sleeve which ignorantly parade its " star " be Stuart Whitman , Stella Stevens and Tony Bill . sure enough , their name do notappear film 's opening credit , much rest ! ! turn out , only movie which connect three actor together be equally obscure Las Vegas Lady ( 1975 ) but what one have do Crater Lake MONSTER be anybody 's guessEven so , pay $1.50 its rental and be monster-movie mood anyhow , elect watch movie regardless and , yup , stink ! apart fact have no-name cast and anonymous crew , unmistakably amateurish air be visible mile away and most could do be laugh JAWS-like pretension and , intentionally so , resistible antic two moronic layabouts-cum-boat owner who frequently squabble bemused local sheriff look . creature plesiosaur i.e. half-dinosaur/half-fish be imperfectly realize ( naturally ) but , as have be case Giant Claw ( 1957 ) which have also just see , do n't seem bother film-makers none flaunt as much can , especially movie 's second half !
movie surely have one strange theme history -- right up there Ed Wood 's impassioned defense cross-dress " Glen or Glenda ? " subject : play bridge . Park Avenue set play ; Bohemians play . Russians -- who speak very questionable " Russian " and have most unconvincing accent when speak English -- play restaurant where work.If be n't interested bridge , one -- even great cast -- be n't likely be much interested bizarre movie.Loretta Young and Paul Lukas be fine . ( well -- Frank McHugh be unlikely ghost writer -- Lukas be unlikely Russian . ) but be all sink fetishistic script .
see " hot " movie when come out 1986 . have X rating brief scene involve oral sex but play mainstream theatre ( be " art " film ) . supposedly be first film ever show respected actress explicit sex scene.What see be boring tale high school boy ( Federico Pitzalis ) love ( understandably ) old woman ( Maruschka Detmers ) . as have be mention Detmers be very beautiful good body but also give very good performance . Pitzalis be ( put mildly ) pretty poor . be wonder never make movie . still , infamous sex scene ( which be explicit but pretty brief ) , slow move dull story which bore silly . good acting Detmers only help certain point . mostly be look my watch wait patiently end . do n't have sequence movie would have be forget long ago . dull and slow . can skip one .

Descent be psychological thriller dynamic character and strong storyline . villain be totally unrealistic and part their performance be enjoyable watch . movie be n't so controversial , have see level gore many film . movie plain suck . synopsis : blonde who think be real hot ( but be n't ) , her admirer , and her admirer 's friend ( no , do n't remember their name ) go wood . their car break down . be warn leave man name Mark . blonde get unreasonably hysterical and next morning ca n't find admirer 's friend . admirer impale his foot ( whoop ! ) . do n't worry , be much more upset when his car wo n't start when get impale nail . nanosecond coax , blond leave find help . event ensue can remember . and movie , be show grotesque torture scene substance include one that make gag . blonde go save admirer house cannibal ( even though all be see eat be intestine , which would logically be last choice real cannibal eat contain actual food ) . blonde find admirer hurt and work very hard ( unsuccessfully ) work up tear . then get good laugh when blonde be house and announce can " out think " .

This be so incredibly bad . poor actor . can tell be try really hard polish turd , but all know ca n't . writing be so obvious and facile , be sad watch try sell . humor and pace be so labor , be hard believe good actor sign this.That say , be so awful be have hard time look away screen . just have know where trainwreck go . but be only catch TV . have actually paid , will be disgusted.So get 2 star be least amusingly/fascinatingly bad . and incidental music ( as oppose trying-too-hard indie soundtrack ) be laughably reminiscent episode Scooby-Doo ... but notas good .

National Lampoons be try follow up 5 year later success Animal House , but completely miss mark . will go chronologically short flicks.Short Film #1Poor Peter Riegert ( Boon Animal House ) . apparently , be n't work back then , so boy National Lampoons probably call and say " hey , be make c**ppy movie , wanna be ? " Peter be " well , be notdo much day , why not? " be great side character Animal House , but could n't carry sorry short flop 5 minutes.POSSIBLE spoiler premise be funny enough , Jason Cooper ( Riegert ) tell his wife leave , need find . be too weird be actually happy marriage . so chase off , there go , and Cooper be charge kid . , course , lead burn house down , lose several kid , and sleep assortment New York bimbo ( include ever so young Diane Lane ) . then wife come back , want kid , and film end coin flip that will decide fate child . idea be actually somewhat clever , but director stink . character all seem be fall asleep , Had be dope up . sorry Boon , your legacy be tarnish flop.Short Film #2MORE SPOILERSEnter Dominique Corsaire . pretty girl , recently finish college , notsure what do her life . so become slut , start sleep around mega rich guy , take their money when die , and do n't stop bed most powerful man world , Fred Willard ( Ooops , mean president United States ) . once again , could have be funny , and be happy Corsaire ( Ann Dusenberry real life ) be n't afraid bare all , her acting be horrible . what waste time.Short Film #3I ca n't believe make far . here be rookie cop Brent Falcone ( Robby Benson ) veteran Stan Nagurski ( Richard Widmark ) .

Nagurski , really , have just give up care . watch mugging , assault , name , and never intervene . figure world be lawless and will probably get sue do anything . even Christopher Lloyd ( end taxi 's run ) get action , get police call , commit crime , but have his lawyer there protect . God bless America ! !Once again , could have be funny , performance be intentionally campy , but goodness , energy whatsoever . Henry Jaglom and Bob Giraldi should be ashamed have their name schlock . think writing be n't bad , idea be there , but execution be pull off as well rescue attempt Iranian hostage crisis . have be part film , would want my name remove , be horrible . then again , that be why watch it.The only good thing garbage be Dr John do film score ( repeat " go movie " and again ) and film be n't much longer hour and half . show one film class head " what should NEVER do film-making .

Texas business trip , be lead vision murder woman 's hometown , La Salle . there come face face person who have frequently appear her vision . man name Terry Stahl , who be play Peter O'Brien . Joanna be now desperate search answer . search that could end result her very own murder.I really do n't know where begin here folk . which should mention first ? atrocious acting , hideous directing , or terribly bland story ? matter which one choose my point be same : simply suck . Adam Sussman 's screenplay be downright moronic . its notinteresting . its notcompelling . its just plain unpleasant . keep wait something jumpstart " film " ( have place quotation film do n't believe ' return ' deserve be call actual film due 's foulness . ) and least give slight chance hope , but nothing ever happen . be leave out unbearable cold freeze . noteven stellar performance actor could have save disaster . course probably know have read script then agree do " film " . assume be why act be so awful . least be what be choose believe . really hope cast do n't pride their performance . need immediate medical attention do.Now directing be unmistakably bad , but ca n't quite crucify Asif Kapadia entirely . ( well could , but wo n't be such nice guy . ) look ' return ' test Kapadia that do n't know , be his first full-length feature " film " . be just get his foot door and still learn . next time around , well there be next time , hopefully will have improve vastly . only thing be able accomplish here be almost completely duplicate visual style Marcus Nispel 's 2003 re-make ' Texas Chainsaw Massacre ' . now be nice " film " be give , but unfortunately still wo n't be receive kudos . copy someone else 's work be n't something consider be praise worthy . ( even be film very much enjoyed.)I think Jim Sonzero 's American re-make ' Pulse ' will now have fork title Worst Film year ' return ' . beyond question be deserve title almost imaginable way . now do n't doubt will make small , and mean very small , profit . matter what though , wo n't surpass or even parallel fluke success Gellar 's previous acting effort , ' Grudge ' . note , there be one last thing will like add . can honestly say have never be embarrass have be see leave theater auditorium see ' return ' . be something never wish experience again , along " film " .
Western society have be feed idea India be poor country . movie only make belief strong . such illustration make all more difficult Indians be accept abroad . agree there be poor and homeless India , but why be there representation educate people notsuccessful ones.I totally hate idea movie portray Patrick Swayze Mother Teressa . my opinion movie have show India very bad light give wrong notion . be unjust discuss only one aspect society . exactly reason why people ask , " when go India , can hire elephant right airport do nothave walk road so full filth and snake ?

First one be much good , have enjoy lot . one have noteven produce smile . idea be show how deep down can human kind fall , but reference character notfilm-maker .
be only question be leave . why do movie suck so much when have such great cast ? why be writing so bad , leave audience completely unconnected character ? why do notmake sense ? why do studio take perfectly good premise and " Hollywood " hell out when all need be good , smart story tell ? why ? never understand why movie that start out good turn pile crap time be release . hope sake Freeman spacey , who be Oscar WINNERS , never be release big screen America.As someone that hold Bachelors Degree Journalism , whole story be just utterly laughable . just ... think script have potential , but execution turn clich , and awful one . just . No.

go see D-War whim and very low expectation . movie fail meet them.I do n't mind story that stretch credulity - remember Reign Fire ? - but do expect be internally consistent . film leap howler howler pause breath , all intersperse special effect that lag far likes LOTR or even Godzilla.A shape-shifting mystic warrior Korea , curiously metamorphose Caucasian antique dealer and pop up deus ex machina get hapless protagonist their late mess . special agent FBI who seem be completely bone up ancient Korean folklore Fed 's excellent " paranormal division " - which have go unremark up point . lover kiss desert beach where exclaim " never mean happen .

First and foremost , Zorie Barber ( Zeke ) , might be one bad actor have ever see . character that be suppose be hip , Village writer martial art and proud be mysterious , why be so hyper , over-dramatic , and plain horrible ? do know anything his character start film ? do director ? do n't martial art teach discipline ? aside , film miss target its lame joke and seen-it-already gross-out humor . hand toilet ? Trainspotting . masturbation ? Hmm.Fast Times Ridgemont High,American Pie , list go on. . .Bad dialogue : one sequence , Eric say " be none my businessbut . ... " and 30 second late Mia say " why be your business ? " bad edit : least five minute worth film be waste NYC traffic shots.It be also impossible believe four main male character would be tight-knit group friend world . ca n't comment what make everyone laugh , but enjoy low-brow , basic bathroom humor and insult , mean , enjoy . want something little smarter but same line , seeBoomerang . want solid what-goes-around romantic comedy , go forThe Tao Steve . but anyone who thinksWhippedis witty and accurate portrayal date , well , can agree .

OK be notAmerican , but my humble Scottish opinion Steve Martin be not, never have be , and never will be funny man long our posterior point southerly direction . Phil Silvers Sergeant Bilko be funny man , doubt due skilled writer and director and all other talented team work character series who contribute perfectly one funny and dateless situation comedy America have ever produce . how anyone could have audacity even attempt replicate Phil Silvers character be . compound thing exercise be repeat Martin 's unfunny attempt be Peter Seller 's Inspector Clouseau , abortive attempt , my opinion , rekindle demonstrably unfunny career . your contributer say ' Steve Martin put his own stamp character ' , that would say ' balderdash ' , his portrayal will be long forget when Silvers and Sellars will be treasure generation come

Del Toro may be interesting , charismatic actor and may resemble Guevara physically , but exude intellectual quality whatsoever , hence make Guevara come off too primitive . cast such mediocrity Bratt , Philips and Franka Incompetente only underline director 's lack sound judgment.The movie be most part extremely slow ( no surprise there ) , and visually uninteresting . even director brilliant Kubrick would have carefully consider release movie that go 3-hour mark , so be quite tell Soderbergh , who have only make one or two solid movie and early his career , would think his oceanic grandness be up task . think film 's length indicate bulk Che 's life have be show here - then think again . Soderbergh focus Che 's last phase , and lot movie be tedious jungle nonsense , full Guevara 's alleged idealism . ( psychopath do n't have ideal . ) do wonder what kind mind highly esteem director have have actually choose ignore Che 's early life . do actually consider too uninteresting ? massacre 600 people hold interest viewer , Huh ? amazing . much good director over-praise charlatan would have easily fit notone but two complete biography 4-hour movie.Soderbergh , sense , become accomplice never address negative , dark side - which be more 90 % - Guevara . spread kind historical inaccuracy , consciously ignore ugly truth ( God forbid should taint holy image Che ) , Soderbergh prove nothumanist - fake image which most Hollywood and pop music personality struggle very hard all their career uphold - but opposite : care only idea , never people whom idea be test ( guinea pig ) . Soderbergh and like be elitist bad kind ; such people often have latent contempt " proleteriat " ( what stupid term ) be supposedly side with.Half student world wear Che 's image their red and orange shirt , but ever know why . have become iconic figure clueless , uninformed , very often young people , who think have man 's face their chest that somehow make appear " edgy " , intellectual , hip or interesting . reality , wear Che shirt only underline one 's overall shallowness and total disinterest self-education . ( would n't want find out more person start advertising his/her face world ? ) Wearing Che 's by-now clich image have become as common have Bart Simpson coffee cup . all " Che-wearers " probably know more Marge 's blue hair will ever read up Fidel Castro 's dead ally.After everything that have be do name Marx , would think mongrel " ideal " would be finally lay rest . seem mankind will never learn . Stalin , Mao , Kim Il , Pol Pot , Castro , Milosevic , Ceausescu , Iron Curtain , hundred million dead , more billion ruin physically and/or mentally system ... so none matter , Huh ? fact Del Toro win Cannes Award should only surprise who be absolutely clueless how Cannes and other European festival work - and vote . hint : Sean Penn head jury notlong ago.For my music-related rant , go : http://rateyourmusic.com/collection/Fedor8/

character acting be little stiff , as be first time man actor have appear screen . unfortunately one good actress , Jean Simmons ( play many bit role TV , Star Trek TNG and Heat Night ) , die quickly and thereafter her acting can be markedly missed.The lead role be Mr Ballard , as portray Cliff Robertson . Cliff be force carry movie his body language most time . do n't do poor job , but be little overmuch ask actor plug ocean blank screen time which character spend their time nottalk and also notacting . Robertson 's most memorable role may have be Ben Parker last 3 Spider Man movie ( star Tobey Maguire).The plot be predictable . husband murder his rich wife her money . thereafter wife seem comeback and haunt husband drive insane leap high window ( fear specter his dead wife approach ) day be predict die less.The second chauffeur Mr Ballard hire look lot English mark Hamill . uncanny really ! only thing that stand out be utter disregard dialogue . many minute pass quietness , one speak , and few act . be shame MST3K guy never get hold movie . could have be much good , notjust predictable , more dialogue , or short scene ' nothingness'.I keep expect G'Mork 's red eye appear shadow and proclaim work " nothing " that inhabit film .

film aka " four hundred blow " be mistranslation.Faire les @card@ coup " means"to live wild life . French,I be stun when see popularity good ,but mean outstanding film . 1.It be notfirst film " nouvelle vague " move ; check Agnes Varda 's " la pointe courte",(1956)Alain Resnais 's " Hiroshima Mon amour"(1958),Claude Chabrol 's " le beau serge"(1958) be anterior .Historically,"les 400 coup " come . 2.The " nouvelle vague " be sometimes ponderous and hard their predecessors:Overnight,Julien Duvivier,Henri-George Clouzot,Claude Autant-Lara ,Yves allgret and lot other be doom oblivion.THis selfishness and contempt be typically " nouvelle vague".You ' ve never hear ( or read ) great generation thirty ( Renoir,Carn,Grmillon,Duvivier already,Feyder ) laugh ,say,Maurice Tourneur or Max Linder.So,thanks Truffaut and co,some people will never discover gem French fifty or forties(Duvuvier 's " sou ciel de Paris",Autant-Lara 's " douce",Yves Allgret 's " une si Jolie petite plage " and " manges").THe novelle vague clique go as far say William Wyler,Georges Stevens and Fred Zinemann be worthless ! 3."Les 400 coup " be technically rather disappointing:it be very academic ,the story be as linear can be,the teacher be caricatures,and mother Claire Maurier deliver such memorable line ( have get be French 1960 understand how ridiculous be ) : well ,your father ' S get only his brevet ( junior school diploma)and,as ,I have get only my high school diploma ! have get know,that 1960,hardly 10%of pupil have HSD France ! Antoine Doinel should have be proud his mother ! want have diplomas,who can blame ? 4.Compared innovation " Hiroshima Mon amour",which feature brand new form,and new " fragmented " content,"les 400 coup " pale significance.Truffaut will master new form only highly superior " Jules and Jim " , help incomparable Jeanne Moreau . 5.The interpretation be rather stiff ; Jean-Pierre Laud ,arguably listenable when dub English ,is still decent,but will soon degenerate most affect his generation . 6.The topic=stolen childhood have good days,before ( Julien Duvivier 's " Poil de carotte " ,Luis Bunuel 's " los olvidados " ) and will have ( Maurice Pialat 's " l'enfance nue",Kenneth Loach 's " Kes " ) do notwant demean Truffaut,his movie be notbad,but,frankly,French movie buffs,prefer " Jules and Jim " " l'enfant sauvage " ( film honest ,true and commercially uncompromizing fault)"l'argent de poche"(as academic " 400 coup " but much more funny)or his nice Hitchcock pastiche " vivement dimanche " .
This be hybrid creature bear Carl Macek mind .

This be possibly bad version play have see - several time stage apart movie.A very nice idea set up - American South can give credible backdrop extreme reaction Hero 's suppose misdemeanour.But execution ! Widdoes be very mannered Beatrice give particularly poor performance . Waterston , fine actor , be notmuch well Benedict.The poor performance be role Don John - make Keanu Reeves look good . perhaps desire make caricature line villain who tie maiden train track fit keystone kop caper Dogberry and his man - but acting make want cringe.Successful set-up include scene where fool Benedict believe Beatrice love - be act competent would be superb . but use river and visual humour Benedict move close be well produced.Overall have force keep watch but certainly do n't keep my attention.Very disappointing.With respect latter comment be nearly 40 . have be watch stage and screen production Shakespeare 2 decade . might suggest when try defend your friend speak piece rather attack other reviewer when be so inadequately arm term fact . can assume though , your distaste regard youth , that be sufficient age where mannered acting bygone day be more your taste.My personal favourite pair be Rylance and Mcteer London stage . Widdoes , Mcteer , skilled and charismatic performer , can act .
have see very terrible horror movie my time , and be n't bad bunch , be certainly low half . script start off OK . young doctor go hospital intern , hope will vault good job and his future wife . cute Huh ? movie then head straight toilet when realize something be kill patient . turn out there be demon basement that be harvest people 's soul . be job 1 doctor , 1 nurse , and 1 security guard entire hospital staff drag mental patient downstairs , do ritual pretty much just involve cut tongue out , and then allow haunted house prop demon come out and steal his soul magic cheesy special effect . point movie get so ridiculously stupid , be beg be over . there be still hour go . look half hour " Tales crypt " episode that somehow get stretch hour and half crap-fest . Tiny Lister do his good John Coffey ( Green Mile ) impersonation Tracy Scoggins play stereotypical frigid Nurse Ratchet , movie fail possible level . give 2 star only TWO reason . 1 ) his fianc be pretty hot , ease pain little end and 2 ) movie actually look OK , lot well current trend horror movie be make wal-mart quality home cameras.In end , avoid turd even have Blockbuster movie pass ( which do , and still feel cheat ) . bonus drinking game , and your buddy take shot time Matt Stasi ( Dr. James Bishop ) shake his head talk . will be drunk 15 minute movie .
 Naming absolutely most pathetic piece crap cinematic history be noteasy task , candidate be so abundant , but Nemesis 2 have be my personal favorite ever see . be so funny have rent again next day , and again laugh so hard be literally roll floor .

No doubt , when Madonna and Guy Ritchie marry , be both think would help their movie career . have be ordeal watch " Swept Away , " then know level be match make hell . nearly 20 year try become respected actress ( or " octress " might have pronounce " Next Best Thing " ) , still ca n't get out long enough turn performance anyone taste could even call decent . and be thing that make people dislike her so much screen : gut feel her ego be so inflate prevent be able just let go and connect her audience . there be justice universe , just blow her last chance .
Life future fascist or near fascist state which severely restrict personal freedom be recurrent theme both modern literature and film maker . such work post warning undesirable trend our society watch out ; but be effective must also be entertaining . unfortunately most book be probably more effective post warning entertain enough become really widely read ; film problem be usually other way round . first such work become really widely know be probably George Orwell 's " @card@ " ( first publish 1948 ) , and be still readily available both form book and film.Watch or read : and then , when be feel little depress man 's inhumanity man , reach Cinderella 2000 . be feather light low budget film comedy base same theme which provide effortless but unreward viewing ; and as 1984 calendar have now pass its erstwhile period . most comedy be lay trowel there be just few genuinely funny moment . exercise your mind long interval can focus question film will gain new extension life be release DVD or will finally disappear oblivion exist tape copy deteriorate past redemption . there be many bad film appear DVD 's day , and frankly do notcare much what happen way.So far good film genre have probably be " Handmaiden 's Tale " , but would very happily swap all well make film Jack London 's towering novel " Iron Heel " . ambitious would be , still seem incredible modern film maker have yet dare attempt ( IMDb only list B/W silent version make Russia 1919 ) .

remember go see movie summer ' 78 my parent , and be pretty time . course , be seven time.Right Jackson movie come out , my wife and rent movie have never see and be feel nostalgic.Ralph Bakshi run out money mid-way animation process movie , and be force drastically cut corner production . movie be do primarily rotoscoping , animation technique people budget , be say something . much movie be animation only very loose sense word . there be scene which be very obviously just people stand front screen , maybe animation effect superimpose top them.Because budget constraint , movie -- already compression " fellowship Rings " and part " Two Towers " -- be pare down even more . what get be sort film-strip version Cliff note books.Its notall bad , though , animation bring warmth , find lack Jackson movie . its nice imagine what could have be like decent funding.This movie be also noteworthy have sequel which never come . several year later , half-hearted half-hour long TV special be air , which be mean wrap thing up . all will say about that be be musical .
do n't know why , but sick reason , think have be Disney sequel binge , decide just go ahead and see 102 dalmation . first movie that be remake Disney cartoon classic star Glenn Close Cruella De Vil , seem sure hit , but be just bomb . think reason why movie do n't work be 101 dalmation , original , be cartoon , just work well and be more appealing kid as well adult . be notreally fun 's adult run try act cartoon instead just actual human being , understand be try make sure be appeal kid , but 's ridicule see way actor be behave film . and 102 dalmation 's story be n't really good.Cruella De Vil have be prison while , but thing change when be prove now love animal and be pleasant human be . but her reputation be now damage puppy-napper , but buy man 's dog shelter and be all sudden be be love everyone and look be change . but when see her probation officer 's Dalmatians , go crazy and start see spot , and loose . be back revenge puppy and be still determine get dalmation coat be always wanted.Glenn Close be such amazing actress , very rate , but her taking Cruella De Vil , be good , but let be face , movie make fun villain just more silly nut case . also , as cute puppy be , just work more animation , sound stupid , but be just notas believable cartoon and their personality be mix . would n't really recommend 102 dalmation , be alright , but agree first movie be just waste time , be just same thing.negative
huge disappointment writer Hamm and director Dante . their previous collaboration first season 's " homecoming " be twist and darkly hilarious all right way . poor handling intriguing premise leave bewilder . supposed " payoff " show generic alien extract something brain infected psychopath be completely unsatisfy and explain nothing . point story be extraterrestrial " cleaning " planet 's human infestation , why do go such gratuitously sadistic and misogynistic fashion ? why notjust unleash completely lethal virus la Stephen King 's " stand " instead have male population butcher female ? keep hope episode would improve keep watch but just get more pretentious and preposterous . religious subtext simply seem force but be clear Sam Hamm must have think be profound weight give . like lot Dante and Hamm 's work but be just unwatchable .

Literally.SUPERMAN TWO just watch again . kid , " think " enjoy action , but now know be story that hold then too , watch over and over again . see Superman Returns child , would have hate then too , think.There be so much heart and soul and superpower go around movie , be sick . superman give up his power love world plot be go on and meanwhile , MEANWHILE , Lex Luther 's get something fantastic his sleeve.SUPERMAN THREE now there be three-way love story Superman and Lana and Clark , only humanity win and Clark 's inner nature beat Superman 's power , when his SUPERmoral nature be go and be SuperHUMAN ( who do human thing his superpower ) , see be notpower Superman be love , be notSUPERpowerman , but SUPERMORTALman love -- and who be really Super . and when tell Clark " prefer " Superman , be elate , have make human connection again . want be accept who be , notjust his ability bend steel . be kind STUFF THAT 's MISSING From SUPERMAN RETURNS.Clark super-sneezes help kid get strike - humanity again . plus , be INERESTING use superpower . be notjust use straight brute strength.He crush coal diamond his woman have sell , love be only thing that drive use his power other saving.It seem there be nothing stake Superman Returns . even Superman Three , see damage cause nemesis ' world domination plot. . see suffering , see how effect Pryor and other and people middle it. . there be damage , esp . emotional Lex 's plot sink US . see glob crystal throw space. . superman have get very creative first three Supermans order stop plot , could n't just " access " his superpower . first one , have stop two missile go different direction and then break his universal mandate and erase history save Lois ' life ...

movie be probably bad movie have ever see . here be thing that immediately jump out : 1 . wood be more hill Los Angeles couple tree and brush . notscary whatsoever . news flash , be film Southern California area , big bear be only hour away . actually have tree there.2 . writing be absolutely doubt bad dialogue have ever experience . possible line movie be unoriginal , clich , or just plain stupid . instance name camp be " camp blood " ( lame ) , name clown be " killer clown " ( lame ) . what be clown do forest anyway ? be only mask could find ? 3 . last but certainly least be acting . absolutely bad group actor and actress ever assemble . virtual cornucopia shitty line and poor act . bad part far be when then randomly flash back fat foreign girl get naked photograph . be really long scene and guess be suppose be sexy , but be not. also , and be one few enjoyable part movie , be tool who be suppose be " athletic . " instance when be bore movie grab couple rock and start do curl . then later be suppose be run clown and be immediately clear his very " girl " run , be quite far athletic . oh and girl who play Kat , good Lord stop singing . song sing credit make want kill myself.If reason do see movie , would least recommend watch special feature . group jackass who make film talk as be really original story . fact one girl actually say let her friend read screenplay and none could predict ending . apparently hang out special kid .
would n't normally write comment on-line , but be bad movie have ever see . notonly be film just soap series ( " young and restless " be really film professional compare ) , but also have awful cut . have action . be full useless garbage.Here be example : guy want kill main character get fire . so ( load crap ) here be : guy put knife his throat and say something " be dead now " . then main character say : " kill be dead . have tell police be threatening " . ( killer ) guy go ( just about cry ) : " oh no ... cop be follow ! ? ! ! oh ... my God".Remember : be just example . really can believe movie actually exist . so : want see WORST movie ever ... go ahead , recommend : )
be skeptical when first see Calvin Kline-esque commercial , but think will give chance . so have watch , and all can say be bleh . movie be so bad . be rare hate movie much . watch flick remind funny scene Altman 's " player , " when writer pitch their bizarre idea producer . will like know which MTV producer decide hour and half long music video adaptation Bronte ( but time Heathcliff 's name be Heath and be rock star , and Hindley 's name be Hendrix ) would be good idea.Even that might nothave be so bad , have notget other aspect film horrible wrong well . direction must have be " be lonely , pout . " laugh out loud all " serious " scene and be bore rest . camera work be jag and repeatedly remind be watch bad movie try be edgy . my theory be sound guy get bore and go down beach few beer his boom -- all could hear half scene be wave . and other scene , wish be could hear . and speak sound , what do Sisters Mercy song " more " be absolutely inexcusable , then again , be inexcusable what do Bronte.On bright side , there be one entertaining scene -- specifically moment when Johnny Whitworth lick Katherine Heigl 's face -- and can tell what scene have do all rest story more power .
film have budget 20 million will just like know where money go . monkey could make good CGI effect then what be waste 3 hour dreadful piece garbage , must admit machine and Martian would have look really , really cool original play-station 1 game , and early PC game mid 90s game have ever be make . what puzzle be where do money go ? pendragon film could have make great film good old fashion model and computer control camera la George Lucas 1975-83 , and actor who actually look care about what be do ( or ruin case ) same 20 million . be quite possibly bad film EVER make ! would rather sit 24 hour repeat screening Ishtar watch film again . hate completely ! regress . say be WORST film EVER make other bad movie Plan 9 or Killer Tomatoes , or Santa Claus Conquers Martian , be film that be so bad have special place your heart , love . there be love film and place my DVD library . sell guy dollar . be bet money film be spend booze and other vice cast and crew . shame Pendragon film ! want my money back !

 Visually disjointed and full , director apparently choose seek faux-depth expand 5 minute plot 81 minute snore-fest.The moment that work film be VERY limit , and character do n't even feel real . how could feel invest main protagonist who be make so surreal ? substantively and stylistically , all feel quirky dream sequence . jarring irregular camera work , awkward silence and gap action , and what be little spider image crawl screen ? whoever think need go back film school . add meaning , just cheese , and do n't even stylistically work rest film ( assume film even have style , which be close call ) . what flop .

film sell one-dollar Wal-Mart DVD and so do notfeel lose anything watch film , my time . enjoy acting Tom Hanks , ( Robbie Wheeling ) , who be very young look and give outstanding performance consider be horrible script . story be about college student who decide play game Mazes & Monsters , only very realistic setting . Robbie Wheeling have have problem past play game other college and be advise his parent leave game alone and get good grade . Robbie meet very nice gal and have romantic fling and once start play game , stop make love and act Monk . there be scene film which be take run former World Trade Center and also Observation floor and Roof area . be rather sad view part film where so many human being die evil world . be notvery good film , Tom Hanks try keep film sink level entertainment .
 Cassavetes be clearly intelligent , sensitive man bold new idea make film . want be auteur , break away confine system and bring new realism American cinema . , applaud him.Unfortunately , member his audience , can applaud Woman influence . Cassavetes take what could have be fascinating topic ( insane woman ) and somehow manage craft dull film , fill lengthy , ad-lib rant and drawn-out scene . seem have have gift capture dull moment person 's life film , and often appear as simply turn camera his family and let motor run and run . tactic would be acceptable Cassavetes have capture something devastatingly real -- or even kernel something so real touch heart way conventional film could not. yet find performance , particularly Rowlands ' , be artificial . never believe moment be really insane . have meet people who be truly mentally disturb , yet have never see act quite like Gena Rowlands Woman influence . play very obnoxious , uninhibited woman who drink lot , and even that be confusing only see drink once ( beginning ) , but act drunk remainder film . there be moment which tap something real , but moment be few and far ; fail sustain seamless mentally disturb character . again , applaud her effort , but effort alone be notenough make performance ring true.Novice audience who happen film and see its high IMDb rating will no doubt feel compel love and rate highly , just prove ' get . ' but do n't be brainwash hype -- judge . do n't have pretend like it.Like Woody Allen , John Cassavetes could be accuse solipsism his film-making , seem find his own psyche and his own life experience so endlessly fascinating could n't imagine other appear presumptive and tortuously self-indulgent . but Woody Allen least have demonstrate gift keep audience entertain -- know compelling story structure and good dose humor be essential movie . Cassavetes have employ self-discipline ( and sharp pair edit shear ! ) , Woman influence could have stand chance . but what be point make ' realistic ' film only people who can stand sit be art-house devotee and film student who worship Cassavetes sort anti-establishment deity ? dumbing anything down , believe Cassavetes could have make Woman slightly more accessible keep pace move actual plot , instead present string 30 minute-long scene ad-lib argument . just make film and few your fan , be just reach already convert . watch movie your own set eye and make your own decision . be truly move and fascinate , good .
 Wow , hate movie . subject matter should have result really fine film , and lead actor be definitely sensitive and talented enough handle topic , but script - there even *was* script - be mess . be less movie random slide show that go nowhere . will say go nowhere fast , that be actually long 81 minute will ever sit through . have mention , lead actor be good . so be Faruza Baulk ( SP ? ) , his sometimes-harsh-but-ultimately-loving-and-accepting mother . film maker have lot answer here , be mess . real shame,because really want like movie , but be basically out-takes movie that never get make . skip one - be n't even worth $6 shell out pay-per-view .
i be enjoy movie most time , but i keep get feeling i be watch child 's movie . i honestly think somebody write pg script and then , film , decide add blood , nudity and language . be big let down . there be that believe child magic that exist movie " babe " ( pig ) or " angel outfield " that defeat evil tooth fairy . parent end up believe their daughter her ability see ghost and utilize skill supernaturally defeat tooth fairy . when i buy movie , i think would be b-film response dreadful darkness fall ; somehow manage make good film 1/4 money , but do n't . make bad film and will probably lose same proportion money lose darkness fall .
cheesy , compellingly awful ( and notfun way ) C Grade movie . everything shout ' amateur ' , crumby script ( bizarre premise , limited coherence and predictable ending ; turgid lighting , sound and hand-held wobbly camera angle ; coy and passe sexual inneundo and reference ; patchy and unbelievable dialgoue Z rate acting . see DVD and keep hope Edward Wood would pop out . be forgive - your Worst Films be work art , and more coherent twaddle.But still , preferable warble ' Every night my dream hear ' - be sure Titanic crew be n't involve side ?
be so disappoint show . hear and read all hoopla , how be " ground breaking show " and sort wild promise quality , try watch it.What letdown ! ! act be way force and exaggerate . story make very little sense . as hint vaunted " look teenager ' life " , could only see paltry attempt that have as much reality reality show.Some be wonder why there be so many negative comment show . reason be be really notall good and beat drum quality show only serve attract attention how poorly make be .

( possible spoiler or two)"Soul survivor " be quite possibly bad theatrical release movie ever . nothing make sense , there be plot girl who have strange vision people who may or may notbe dead . entire movie be just bunch random shot thing that do n't really tie together , end film.Tha acting be non-existent , camera work be jerky and script be so confusing , just make movie even harder watch.I keep wait something tie movie together but nothing come . definitely bad film year . -****1/2 star .
absolutely dreadful Mexican film supposedly base short story Edgar Allan Poe newsman want go confine asylum hide wood write story how work , etc ... when our hero , Gaston , be give grand show Dr. Maillard , head asylum , see kind thing which be suppose be horrific , such man hang around long dungeon , and comedic , such our hero be joke upon soldier climb down ladder hang side building . then there be one sight which might have be mean be : human man dress chicken , yes , that be right chicken , that peck ground chicken feed . scene be be comedic highlight film , but , least , be film 's low point and really most revolting when consider grow man and woman think might even be remotely entertaining . ah ! be indeed real horror that be Dr. Tarr and his legion Name Changes . and bring salient fact film which be most film that undergo multiple title change usually have kind serious problem . yes , be obvious , but have distribution problem and other , which be one , have numerous title change someone might unsuspectingly buy same garbage more once . be definitely garbage . have very little go . only performer worth have look be Claudio Brook head asylum . be one huge slab ham laugh maniacally , bellow order , sashay sword hand , and praise chicken . get so tired hear talk " soothing system " his mean cure mentally sick . what bunch ludicrosity(Hey , film script deserve kind word ) . wo n't take long figure out what be go asylum nor will be more interesting . cinematic chicken scratch !
what ... ... ... . . be ? must , doubt , be big waste film , setting and camera ever . know ca n't set your expectation 80 's slasher high , but be too stupid be true . baught film 0.89$ and still feel urge go claim my money back . can imagine who hard stink ? who be violent killer film and what be his motivation ? ? ? well actually , could n't possible care less . and why should ? maker piece garbage sure do n't care . do n't try create tiny bit tension . director ( Stephen Carpenter -- guess be much easy find money name ) also make Kindred ( 1986 ) wich be rather enjoyable and recently do Soul Survivors . complete crap well , but least have Eliza Dushku . junk have debut Daphne Zuniga ! ! ! ( who ? ? ) Yeah that be right , Melrose place chick . very memorable character die about 15 min . opening credit . be second person die . first victim die directly first minute , but nobody seem mention or miss afterwards so who care ? rest actor ... do n't deserve term actor actually , be completely uninterest . be hope die quick and painful death ... and notonly their charactersMy humble opinion = 0 / 10
there have ever be bad comedy ' Gray Matters ' be unaware . New York Jewish comedy 's ' funny ' premise be sibling Sam & Gray be mistake couple and so decide fix Sam up girlfriend , only find Gray be equally attract their target - Charlie . revelation Gray be secretly gay be apparently only surprise . there be deeply offensive wedding sequence , deeply embarrassing ' drunk act ' Moynahan and Graham , and performance that would embarrass forest everywhere its woodenness Tom Cavanagh . Sissy Spacek demonstrate complete inability do comedy and will want excise her resume . Molly Shannon play homely friend lumpen insouciance . only Alan Cumming emerge credit but be seriously under-employed and give nothing which work . whole disaster be cement Graham 's bizarre eye-rolling performance culminate penultimate scene where wear comedy hat and overcoat scene be set lesbian bar . be astonishing film be ever release have redeeming feature and should be avoid cost .

film be probably inspire Godard 's Masculin , fminin and urge see film instead.The film have two strong element and be , ( 1 ) realistic acting ( 2 ) impressive , undeservedly good , photo . apart , what strike most be endless stream silliness . Lena Nyman have be most annoy actress world . act so stupid and all nudity film , ... be unattractive . compare Godard 's film , intellectuality have be replace stupidity . go too far subject , would say that follow difference ideal French and Swedish society.A movie its time , and place . negative .
 *May Contain Spoilers* few week have originally write my review Hood live Dead realize may have be bit too harsh movie . which be why decide would do something have never do before . review same movie again . do n't get wrong , still do n't like movie , still think be dreck , and still think zombie do n't look all zombie-ish . story movie be still my opinion , weak and rather lame . story be about guy name Rick , who work scientist ( that just happen be work serum thing that heal sick cell , animal ) and his brother Germaine , two be n't exactly good term ( my my , original plot point ) and argue lot . One day Germaine be shoot drive-by shooting , and Rick call up his scientist buddy bring serum try resuscitate Germaine(whereas most people would have call 911 , but whatever ) , naturally serum fail and Germaine " die " ( that do n't happen there will have be movie ) , police and coroner ( end time will still think maybe paramedics should have show up ) leave scene show coroner van ( which still believe be just someone 's van " coroner " decal throw side ) , and Germaine return life attack and kill paramedics . would talk more plot , but feel reveal more story would n't want watch ( and would n't want now would ? ) , but suffice say story ( my opinion least ) meander and be rather slow move ( pun notintend ) . have previously say my review zombie do n't look all much like zombie , still think look have be bar fight . be notsay should all be decay and whatnot , but still there should least be bite mark victim . also still do n't like fact director(s) continually switch up pace which zombie move . could n't really seem decide on or nothave zombie run or shamble ( most zombie movie do ) , do n't get wrong , be all run zombie but make up your mind people . one scene zombie run living , and other just shamble . and sometimes just do n't seem believable ( yes know their fictitious creature but still ) , be course refer zombie that run his hand wall as be walk dark living room , and still do n't like zombie who be lie ground , get shot , then jerk be just shoot . sound movie also bother , mainly music , which may have just be my copy film seem pretty much non-existent . music movie be important folk . especially when sound edit doe sound director just take friend camcorder and shoot little zombie flick . acting be still atrocious ( my opinion ) and be par American " actor " Japanese zombie movie junk . movie be still bad , almost House Dead bad , be good , doubt , but then again be notsay much . be notbad movie there , and be good lot direct video movie that be out there but end day be n't good . also think movie move really really slow , fact be only hour and twenty or so minute ( and yes , still do n't like opening song ) . be type movie think be well-suited be premier Sci-Fi network . which be why be obligate give debacle film one out ten . but think way , least be notnegative one .
 Simply terrible ! why would n't use actual actor ? look , have stop ! stop use non-actors ! want credibility or message send low-budget film ... please love god use real actor ! most will work free ... take advantage ! now back my comment ... anyway , humour be low bathroom variety and be n't funny level . as quality ... one scene film public transportation bus could see reflection crew ... guess what ? be one guy what look Sony Camcorder and probably noteven his . well , assume only audience film be people gore fetish ... and be n't even good gore .
 Wow , here finally be ; action " movie " action . real low-budget setting ( do n't miss hilarious fly saucer fly few time ) future Seattle find no-brain hardbody seek avenge her childhood.There be nothing even remotely original or interesting plot and actor ' performance be only rival stupidity attempt steal other movie , mainly " Matrix " have money do right . yes , do get see running wall and slow motion shoot-out ( 45 sec approx. ) but scene be about as cool stupid hardbody 's attempt make joke male incompetence now and then.And , yes , be also serve number lead that lead absolutely nowhere , as script be thought-out previously unseen cast shoot scenes.Believe , be as bad possibly can get . fact , do n't deserve be take seriously , but perhaps can make notrent and save your money .
This be just horrible plot be just OK , but rest be be bad . mean come puppet and then even try make movie digital and make even bad ! normally would like low-budget movie but be just waste time and almost make want return set come on . have about ten low-budget movie set 6-8 movie and would have say be bad movie out . also wording be off and use fake plastic machete that do n't even look real one , could use one that look even little close real one so save your time and money and do n't watch horrorible movie .
film really try hard . your go make horror film , least give reason believe hook viewer.you wait and wait film expect grand explanation but do n't . instead try be too clever ending and notrevealing anything.what be point movie ? where be actually go ? and more importantly what hell be go . . .why be there and how do tie anything ? just weak sci-fi horror . i love fake review IMDb say how great be related press release bump movie ( either or people have low horizon ) . be notworth your 2hrs all.i be notsay film be good fragile , but least give reason and why thing happen and have end result . do n't and just waffle be ton padding make everything feel scary . film be about as low when stranger call . god that be lame too.big tip , your gonna make horror , make believable reasoning and explain viewer what be go on , so have hook your story . there be reasoning or believability then there be firm hold anything and ca n't be scary . disrespect cast or crew cause do good job . be just poor writing .
 Inappropriate . PG rating movie get be yet huge misstep MPAA . whale Rider get PG-13 but movie get PG ? please . parent do n't be fool , take elementary school child movie be huge mistake . there be numerous time find be uncomfortable notjust humor be inappropriate kid , but also be totally out blue and unnecessary.But all aside , Cat Hat be still terrible movie . casting and overall look movie be only saving grace . beautiful Kelly Preston and always likeable ( or hateable case ) Alec Baldwin be both good their role even Preston be almost too beautiful role . kid be condition actor and show , especially Dakota Fanning . Fanning be only human aspect film that keep watch and notthrow thing screen.Did mention there be oversized talk cat movie ? Mike Myers be absolutely deplorable . do n't like voice Shrek , and truly believe now Myers should notbe allow realm child 's film ever again . his portrayal Cat be slightly tone down version Fat Bastard and Austin Powers.In end , cat should nothave come , should have stay away , but come , even just day , ruin 82 minute my life , 82 minute personal anger and strife.The Cat Hat may be bad kid movie ever .
do n't enjoy film . think act be n't very good and story be boring . 20year old computer save day ? think be just slightly far fetch , even film . could n't figure out why could n't just turn off , why nottake sledgehammer it.Its shame , but original film 80s expect so much more what be actually deliver . film could have be 21st century version old film , be n't . be what want watch , do notwatch film ! even old computer have n't have turn up save day , would still , my opinion , be very very cheesy flick. .
have never pan film on-line , but feel move do so , see one . do n't show up someone 's funeral and say bereave , " my relative die , so why should care ?

want read other comment leave my review and majority definately rule : movie be aweful ! acting non-realistic animation countless error . be actually hope flap would have be extend stretch imagination ( ca n't extend flap engine ) . landing gear can be lower have electricity . tiny little fan that be go be notsufficient stretch lower landing gear . one thing think be quite peculiar be when land , back wheel touch down and then nose break off , thus suspend plane back tire air . how do captain apply left and right brake tire that be n't touch ground ? do forget spoiler ? word director : find out *all* can plane attempt " plane " movie . sorry technical rant , but give movie negative .
astonishing waste production money be filmic proof rich and famous can be just as stupid and wasteful politician . ( silly ) play Tennessee Williams and directed ( dead hand ) Joseph Losey and star Taylor and Burton and Noel Coward - project film spectacular cliff-top mountain island mansion Mediterranean must have seem sure fire winner when present Universal 1967 . result be so absurd and tedious almost defy belief . visually film be spectacular but that be force nature that have allow setting and fact real home be use instead set . shrill antic screeching Taylor , Burton 's half asleep wandering , loony dialog , Noel Coward laugh , ridiculous story and plot device and absurd costume simply irritate viewer . boom be disgrace , waste money and talent and clear proof that laud famous people can be idiot just rest planet 's pleb . noteven fun . just terrible and mad shocking waste .
horror-movie fan try watch significant novelty genre , especially which be product my native cinema . and can say that " Power Fear " ( or " Vedma " Russian title ) be one weak film . firstly , ca n't scary even little kid , pace so slowly and so predictable there be place real horror . frankly speak , be bad point : goofy plot ( do n't know why Russian producers/director decide transform classic story Ukrainian witchcraft lame and ridiculous modern-day-America thriller . absolutely agree previous reviewer do n't thrill bit ) and terrible and cheesy actor ' work . actor include lead Valeri Nikolayev and Yevgeniya Kryukova who be quite famous Russia look wooden doll or something like and seem do n't even bother play , only speak their English line expression . and end do n't really understand why film flick English Russian actor ? think be their wrong turn . least could cast American or English actor lead part make look more convincing . same can say about so call " small American town background " which be shoot Estonia and look . only positive moment find " power fear " be visual effect . be notexcellent but rather good Russian film . and music be OK , least do n't irritate . be why give two star . overall , want see good horror film do n't waste your time and money boring flick . and be look something that claim be Russian horror will advise find copy " Viy or spirit Evil " . be really terrific movie base same novel " Power fear " but much , much good .
This be typical example technically highly skilled director video clips/commercials try do their first full feature length movie . one hand imagery , camera , lighting , CGI and even sound be highly polished and have truly " expensive " look and feel . even actor show certain amount potential - point where even good acting could nothide bad plot.In case be notbad plot but hardly plot all.So 50 % dialog consist " what hell be ? " , " what be ? " and " what hell be ? " . none case any character nor audience be provide slight hint answer though . most other dialogue get feeling there never be form dialogue book and actor have freely improvise plot that be n't ever explain them.The only reason why Skye Bennet 's performance could be so good be her character autistic girl do n't allow give tragically horrible dialogue line other actor have deal . way be able just show her acting talent which rest cast could n't even get close . mean there be notone actor world that could make up dialogue this:Ben : be real , Huh ? Emily : stop . Ben : mass psychosis , Huh ? Jon : somebody have take control situation . Ben : situation ca n't be control . not, notanybody . Emily : noteither . Ben : NoGot goosebumps . but nothorror , more horrible attempt . moment feel ashamed actor have add their vita.2 star excellent technical work .

when first pop happy birthday , check timer see how long film be . be amaze length . animated and horror film share common ground : attention span selected audience and that should be or right 90 minute . anything more , and will lose bulk your audience.This 110 minute , or 20 minute its prime be huge problem . will like say half movie could have be edit out , but would be too generous say . go ahead and watch and tell how many scene could have be edit , even be film major.Regardless overstay visit , movie be below mediocre . spend its time try be huge mystery which " elite 10 " be kill off remain friend . most part , notonly over-do , but zoom face and pretty much say " be guy ! no ! be gal ! " will spend more time camera mislead actually enjoy movie . and do n't get start acting.Okay , that get start . have laugh beginning try remember Melissa Sue Anderson play character that go blind Little House Prairie ( later , research prove my suspicion correct ) all way movie , genuinely look blind . strange , established actress , should have be good group , but turn out bad . rest staff , aside Ann ( Bregman ) be pretty damn bad , too , but , uh , take cake.The movie begin group ten friend , and be immediately kill off . barely anyone think twice " dear " friend 's disappearance , so continue their merry way . slowly , then more rapidly , there be revelation Virginia 's ( Anderson ) , main character , past and her psychologist , who be tad bit more personal ( and CALL 24/7 , apparently ) most shrink . all while , more and more death occur.What be funny be , just first " disappearance , " more " good bud " vanish , less rest care . sure , give few second air time say " Wow , ( person ) just would n't run off " etc , but then be back their sexual way . and speak which , be probably due horrid script , or maybe be who be lose interest minute 30 , but be really hard keep up who like who group all seem be sexual partner next or someone would either be freak out MAX and good friend next scene . see : creepy guy that keep mouse/rat his pocket literally and be most obvious suspect . be give film too much credit ( and time , ) but how become part " elite 10 " will never know.But , digress , there be mystery here . why be kid target ? why be Virginia think 's kill someone , when be never proved ( ' end ) actually have be slaughter ? and why would trailer and poster claim killing be " Six most bizarre murder will ever see " ? hell , even 1981 , most have be show first two Friday 13th film coincidentally enough , Friday 13th Part 2 be release 2 week day happy birthday . perhaps , be speak when film month prior , but be late , well , party.When " secret " be reveal , trust , will have rewind 3-4x actually get laughable and incoherent motive , and even then , put subtitle get all mumble victim/killer 's word . even get first time , be unbelievably outrageous and hilarious finale . be almost worth watch whole movie again , but drinking game.This birthday gathering should be avoid . be horrible and illogical first draft script please , please know take multiple rewrite camera role , contain way act or extreme act and be 100 % unrealistic how people react extraordinary circumstances.Side note : when be kid , or say 10-11 year old , love horror film . ( still do , oddly . definite guilty pleasure , but be get hard and hard watch year pass . ) get our first VCR , and tape many horror film network ( or , EDITED VERSIONS ) TV . all remember happy birthday be get last 10 minute tape , which scare death and obviously give away big mystery who killer be . even have see other clip movie , think be first full-length viewing have have . thankfully , awful movie do n't wound child . be old now , and can take trash . but never again.Side note 2 : that say , crazy " happy birthday " song play end credit ( and as score ) still creep out tremendously . guess , movie ( or last few minute , ) do have influence my childhood . shame , Melissa Sue Anderson !

original Trancers be notmean great movie . have massive plot hole and very little way internal logic . however , be entertaining , well do most low-budget B-movies , and could be surprisingly witty . unfortunately , Trancers II be none these.Trancers II suffer many same problem most flop sequel . plot be thin enough see and writing be insipid . seem people movie feel bring familiar face first movie back would be enough , and do n't bother anything else . noteven veteran B-grade actor Tim Thomerson and Jeffery Combs be able drag film out muck.A brief plot overview : Jack Deth ( Thomerson ) be cop future who be send 1985 save ancestor member his government . Trancers II take place six year event first Trancers . Jack Deth be marry Lena ( Helen Hunt ) , woman meet first movie , and live Hap Ashby , man Deth be send past protect . be discover brother Whistler ( bad guy first movie ) have travel back time create army Trancers , people turn mindless killing zombie , kill Ashby . complicate Jack 's mission be fact his first wife , who have die long Jack travel past , be also send back stop Whistler 's brother , and now Jack find work her.I have two real problem movie . One be method create Trancers movie be radically different method use first movie . what make annoy be , rather poor example Soviet revisionism , act be always technique.The other thing that annoy be love triangle Deth , Lena , and Alice Stilwell ( Jack 's first wife ) be give very little screen time . bother particularly be much more interesting actual plot movie . feel be just something that be throw fill space movie . Alice 's character particular seem very unconcerned fact be reunite her husband only find be re-married , make either very shallow or very poorly written.The only reason can think watch movie be be interested watch entire Trancers series ( currently total six movie ) . otherwise , even be fan original Trancers , stay away tepid sequel .

documentary film be base incomplete consideration evidence , which Brian Flemming , perhaps purposely , fail mention important evidence contrary . perhaps his most crucial mistake be one early : his claim concern invalidity Paul 's testimony Jesus Christ disregard key fact , like : **The existence formulate creed Paul 's letter . creed suggest most central claim Jesus be already formulate statement faith possibly few year Christ 's death and resurrection . **The testimony early Christian ca n't just be toss out mere fantasy . there be indeed many people claim be Messiah period , but only ONE have remain : Jesus . why ? would have be preposterous anyone have actually believe Christ be Messiah , and go on die belief , know have notbe resurrect . **Even Gospels be date more liberally , be still talk account Jesus write lifetime other eyewitness that would have point out inaccuracy Gospels . and there be evidence Gospels be write much earlier.What be say be Flemming 's documentary be incredibly bias and self-serving piece work hodge podges different argument and evidence serve his anti-Christian view . do n't be fool poor investigation .
movie be boring , character and scenario be unrealistic , unbelievable , action be hilarious . movie be big mess . almost seem when action music kick , most impressive stunt be run . voice be dub over Mr. McGregor or Steven sing too much and change his voice . there be way too much dialog movie , and extremely bad acting everyones behalf . movie be great sleep therapy . fighting be laughable . eye shape shift effect evil designer drug addict female be decent . main villain be joke and his character be poorly develop . main villain be use explain story interrogation , would just throw random plot such ( spoiler ) " CTX ( his designer drug)is go be water supply " which be never address conclusion or even mention again movie . movie be highly recommend pass .

rent Netflix somebody give Roger Ebert 's book " hate , hate , hate movie " and give one rare zero-star rating book and say end his original review " Mad Dog Time should be cut up provide free ukulele pick poor " . so figure Ebert say would see be really as bad say be . know most society say notlisten critic and judge but could notexpress how much hate piece junk Ebert do and never Ebert 's review Rob Reiner 's " North " where say hate movie ten time have ever hear such brilliant hatred movie review . here have Richard Dreyfuss gangster which do n't think would be terrible see Dreyfuss gangster screenplay movie be write well . but all other thing that be awful " movie " can certainly tell script be notwrite well . movie start off Jeff Goldblum say enjoy watch Dreyfuss 's girlfriend Dreyfuss be criminal hospital movie start off decent dialog opening credit . but first 4 or 5 minute other 85 minute just consist dumb character talk pointless garbage 30 second then someone get shot . then there be whole bunch joke Dreyfuss be mentally ill .

 Honestly be noteven joke when say be one bad movie have ever see ! film dose n't have single ounce originality its flimsy dialog or its blatantly plagiarize story line . can noteven begin count number thing film that be obviously rip off " omen " and other movie . example nanny " Lucy " film be actually one devil 's minion send guide and protect spawn Satan ... ..does sound lot Mrs. Baylock anyone else . thing be orphanage be first get child burn ground just few month be adopt , just " omen " . however luckily one priest survive blaze and escape sever burn all his body ... .yet coincidence ? ? ? ? ? ? and top off burned priest be stay hospital room picture Jesus wall , much priest " omen " have page Bible plaster wall wall-paper . please do n't even get start draw comparison ending movie and " omen " have state there be far too many mention here .
film be portrait half-spastic teenage boy Benjamin who have visit board school his lousy mark Math . do n't make good experience life and get serious self-esteem issue . rough start his new school , start make friend , fall love girl and do American Pieish teenage stuff.Beside comedy element , film be tell very serious way , focus Benjamin and his problems.If already do n't like story outline , save your time and watch something else . do , please be aware following:1 ) Benjamin be total loser . whatever do , do terribly wrong and then go self-pity all time . be n't kind " charming loser " who can feel sympathy and laugh . instead and his behavior really annoy and my own teenage year notfar could barely stand watching.2 ) film hardly try be realistic and story seem be but my experience character just be n't ( Janosch maybe ) . and yes , know film be base auto-biography write 17-year old - but have experience German school and German youth , do n't believe him.3 ) show sexual awakening really be important thing film subject . but doubt teenage boy do " Ejaculate cookie"-contest where everyone have hit cookie his sperm mass-masturbation wood and loser have eat sperm-wet cookie afterwards . kinda amuse contemptible way , be nor funny neither underline serious attempt film.4 ) there be sub-plot Benjamin 's family and his father betray his wife - still , do n't know why be there and where put . just bored me.Well , personally hate film have character Benjamin , be message , concept , scheme , whatever and be fail attempt be dramatic and serious . however , can image people may find sensible and touching . like " other Sister " will probably like one , too . hate both.17-year old boy should n't write autobiography and do , do n't seem be good idea make film out it.2 out 10 .
see movie once , and think be OK . then my friend work say " Watch again , be good " . so do . and my surprise , be WORSE second time ! there be word limit , so be go get ball roll here.-The bombing scene be all so stupid . why earth would anyone wait trigger explosion ? ? ? -None character here be even remotely likable . notfirst time , noteven second.-Oh , and last time check , car do notexplode single gun shot , nor can fire THAT huge be put out tiny fire extinguisher ... do above negative viewer actually watch movie ? ? ? -The camera be so shaky , can barely tell what be go on . opening scene robot have my stomach off-put , rest movie be notmuch better.-The sniper scene . McManus Brothers ( " Boondock Saints " ) would roll their eye , be so stupid . first off , why do guy plant his gun where one person have get shot ? furthermore , why would spend THAT much time clean bullet , reloading , aim and notget shot , when there be so much chaos go ? -SAS type run instead stay and fight back ? ? ? ? ? ? Huh ? ? ? ? ? be soldier ... gay ... ? ? ? do n't mean sound homophobic , but honestly , scene be so ridiculous.-Too long its own good , yet too short amount material cram . Bigelow seem think more action , well . look like be wrong- movie be full superfluous action scene throw there distract lack central plot . know Watchmen be long 163 minute , but least movie do n't drag . movie , other hand , do , and , feel longer.The only good thing be Renner , who be satisfactory good . but do favour , just skip , and do n't give hype .
reiterate what be say movie , would like add be look forward watch film ... cast/location and work excellent director Michael Winterbottom etc ... have vague shadow ' do n't look now ' storyline beginning . stay different surroundings ( Italy again ) dim heartbreak loss ... or perhaps be how see ? so consequently sit there wait story unfold and put spin what expect happen family foreign European country ... .and sit there and sit there ... .and guess what ? nothing actually happen ! and mean nothing ! ! be noteven give chance get character be so 1 dimensional and vacuous..You be lead believe pace movie something be go happen turn whole film be head ... eldest daughter flirtation local vespa boy , have great scope take movie direction , young daughter vision her dead mother end be fruitless and pointless exercise , father attempt be seduce one his female student feel ridiculous give his age . feel as script have last recall make where decide last minute eradicate gut story and go pare down bare minimum effect . when credit start roll ( unexpectedly ) ca n't help but feel rob your time spend sit watch pile rubbish .
Poor Paul Mercurio . land role Scott Hastings Strictly Ballroom , good film history , manage find do lot rubbish . none character film be very unlikable , or even hateable , but Mercurio 's lead be sort person prefer ignore - completely unloveable and wear OVERALLS . big mistake costume design , that one .

 Yes there be great performance here . unfortunately , happen context movie that do n't seem have clue what be do . first 45-60 minute this all music take place realistic performance . suddenly , hour , character who , point , have always speak other , suddenly start sing other . further confuse thing , little further in , out nowhere , actually do about 15 minute sung-through dialog , then seem drop idea and move other thing , such number that begin jazz club drummer and two electric guitar suddenly turn fully orchestrate piece massive unseen string section . top all inconsistency how music be use , be composer ' clear inability actually write music style that be supposedly be portray . first couple piece do sort mimic 1950s Motown sound , rest film be just ( bad ) Broadway show music . then there be pure silliness snippet group do bad Jackson family imitation and Eddie Murphy morphing Little Richard James Brown Lionel Richie . when start channel Stevie Wonder could n't help laugh out loud . be clearly one film that make appreciate how little time have earth and resent waste two hour watch film .
what can say film other " do n't see " . wait and wait and wait someting ( or anything ) happen and just do n't come . watch amazingly two people walk around set record most filler screen time single movie . what be do ? be solve mystery ? be gather clue ? possibly , be just hard tell . end movie , lot radio signal be decode ( illegibly sort Pet monitor ) and guy give lecture , plot be finally reveal and toss aside quickly as possible . alien want get back their home world Utopia and be so happy there want blow up earth ( guess do n't share wealth ) . my guess be finish film and see their 35 minute work or art ( garbage ! ) and decide will let edit crew turn 88 minute feature film . watch your own peril , be noteven funny be so bad , be just bad .

 Stilted , stagy , strange and opaque , visually striking ... wannabe-erotic fantasy . really boring , way too much male nudity ( include father-son incest ) , and just sort shameless pointlessness . will confess , however , certain passage dialogue , take their own term , do have lull , haunt quality .
movie be prime example squander great resource film . have get future SNL and SCTV star their prime , such John Candy , Chevy Chase , Laraine Newman , Al Franken,Tom Davis and Joe Flaherty essentially make 70 minute coarse , uninspired fart and racist joke . concept network future subvert society could have really be take interesting extreme , but instead right gate , make lame , juvenile proctology joke and stay vein humor whole way.Seek early and much more subversive and witty Groove Tube or late , hilarious Kentucky Fried Movie . movie be only who want see time capsule bad 70 's sketch comedy movie .
idea be have something interesting happening first ten minute keep audience hook . late Night Shopping manage avoid interest much long . when do get point , be so monumentally moronic keep think must have misunderstand . but didn't.Sean tell story Osaka landlord who rent same apartment two people same time who work different shift and so do n't realise be share . his friend ask " but what weekend ? " Sean do n't have adequate explanation . Sean then tell story his own similar problem , which be be n't sure his girlfriend be still live home work night and work day never see other . have be go three week . but his friend do n't ask : " yes , but say before , what weekend ? must see then . do n't make sense . what be go about , Sean ? be medication or something ? " but let be be generous and assume both work seven day week.We see Sean check see soap and towel have be use . ( fact , bizarrely , start carry soap around . ) but what his girlfriend 's conditioner and shampoo , sanpro and moisturiser , toothpaste and toothbrush . let be go kitchen . what food and drink ? be any miss ? have any be buy ? bedroom , have share bed be make or not? be clothes be use and exchange clean one ? be laundry basket fuller ? toilet , be seat up or down ? mean , good grief ! and cap Paul arrange leave work early see his girlfriend be still live home . why do n't just phone ? but get bad . last act no-one tell Vincent where rest group be go manage find . Lenny 's love interest and Sean 's girlfriend conveniently appear be good friend and also manage find group . there be n't even slight attempt explain extraordinarily unlikely coincidences.To be fair dialogue be OK but notnearly good enough make up weak character or annoyingly lame story.I hear one actor interview and promise " gun , drug , corset . " think , " great " . but half-an-hour tedium be yell screen : " want gun ! want drug ! want corset ! " would n't have take much sort problem but official website director boast film be n't script-edited . be need know .
Well , least my theater group do , lol . so course remember watch grease be little girl , be never my favorite musical or story , do still hold little special place my heart be still lot fun watch . hear horrible thing grease 2 and be why decide never watch , but my boyfriend say really be n't all bad and my friend agree , so decide give shot , but call up and just laugh . first plot be totally steal first one and be n't really clever , notmention just use same character , but different name and actor . tell , how do Pink Ladies and T-birds continue year former gang leave ? notmention creator face motor cycle enemy , gee , what striking resemblance guy first film as well T-bird be just stupid and ridiculous.Another year Rydell and music and dancing have n't stop . but when new student who be Sandy 's cousin come scene , be love strike pink lady , Stephanie . but must stick code where only Pink Ladies must stick T-bird , so new student , decide train T-Bird win her heart . so dress up rebel motor cycle bandit who can ride well and defeat evil biker easily kick T-Bird 's butt . but will tell Stephanie who really be or will find out her own ? well , find out yourself.Grease 2 be silly TV show sort that do n't work . gang do n't click as well first grease do , notmention Frenchy come back be bit silly and unbelievable , think graduate Rydell , but apparently do n't . song be notreally catchy ; be glad Michelle be able bounce back so fast , but be probably be only one talent silly little sequel , would n't really recommend film , other be curious , but warn , be just pathetic attempt more money famous musical.negative

do n't waste your time film . could have be good , but end be one lame have ever see . seriously have wonder how people involve making film could have look final scene and think , " yeah ! now there be ending ! " and pat back . seem more just run out idea ! build up final scene have cool twist , but instead just let whole build-up fall flat 's face . when last shot fade black and hear credit music start be shock - could notbelieve what be see and that someone could even call ending . good thing anyone could do film be rewrite end and give substance . seriously , will really love get whoever come up one room , look face and say - WTF ? ? ! ! ! !

when movie " Dukes Hazzard " bring $75 million make incredibly sad statement condition our own society . either be collectively too stupid stay away trash or maybe be just notrealize how many people kind no-effort trash will appeal to.Hollywood have have incentive make good movie put out trash then people will see anyways there be nothing else screen . be . walk out get free movie pass . dialogue could notbe dumb . stunt could notbe more over-the-top and outrageous . perhaps " big big " image appeal Texans but do n't appeal nor anyone else theater . none " big name " be career-ending flick , Burt Reynolds , which say need hear . Jessica Simpson -- do n't make laugh.I would n't even recommend film video , even be desperate . be about fool public make enough money open day equal or do good cost marketing . do public be forewarn . stupidity abound .

Fu Manchu turn long bearded old man,into bright young Asian/Elvis rock star ! ( back singer no less ! )Set real reason,in 1930's,Peter Sellers do his good material hand but be notgive really good reason his " comedic " moment . rest actor be just plain dull and my brother and sit all barely laughing anything . be only natural be expect " Pink Panther " type comedy,Peter Sellers be so great that.It be pitiful shame be his last film die . his appearance Muppet Show be more entertaining ill-conceived flop . Still,I do n't fault . fault everyone else involve nottry make good film . 2 star be be generous ! !

love shark . and mutant . and explosion . theoretically , parameter mind , HAMMERHEAD : Shark Frenzy should have be good movie ever.It be not.The monster look villain Power Rangers , and have approximately same range rubbery movement . might be okay maker be n't quite as proud its design seem be . be say , guy big rubber suit action/scifi/horror flick that could benefit mystery , shark get lot screen time . grant , be usually shaky and erratic . guess be suppose assume be so scary even camera guy freak out.The camera go person about get eat , camera go shark . camera go back person about get eat , only now be scream and armless . and so on.The costume be bad , acting be poor , and special effect be sub-par , but writing be far bad . thing happen completely randomly so more people can be eat , or so something can explode . Let Me Tell , people who make movie definitely go more explosion = more good mindset . character shoot car and there be massive explosion . shoot helicopter , there be massive explosion . barrel , rock , tree , WHATEVER , all explode , so much so freak shark even explode end.Speaking which , do n't care how crazy person be , find hard believe anyone would think try make giant half-person half-shark have sex woman order make freaky shark people baby be good idea . be , UNLESS person be mad scientist movie.The bad thing be , movie be so random ( and time , boring ) even its badness be notreally enough hold person 's prolonged interest . might be good one MST3K your friend , but past , happen catch bad boy , do favor and change channel .

This be well make informative film vein PBS Frontline . problem be , Frontline already do piece and manage bring L. Paul Bremer tell his side story . more troubling be fact director film , Charles Ferguson--a former think tank wonk , be war supporter occupation go south . what do think would happen ? invasion Poland go really well too be mess up pesky Nazis.And that be what film feel like--an apology occupation rather deconstruction act war itself.Ferguson seem suggest war could have be run better--as war can be good .
go see movie crowd that consist predominantly " spiritual " New Age type , who , quite , very much enjoy movie---although accord that also know book ( apparently there be book that contain more nonsense ) , movie be notquite as good . so , tend think " spiritual " , believe or least can tolerate stuff " aura " and " astral body " , and do n't mind frequent use term " energy " context physics or technology , might actually like movie , and will likely even more enjoy whatever book be apparently base on.However , be mostly touch physical universe , your ability suspend disbelief be easily exhaust inane New Age nonsense and plot base thereon , addition that have low tolerance cheesy lighting effect denote happening spirituality , and perhaps even expect reasonable non-wooden dialog acting , then be my recommendation regard movie : stay . Away.Do n't even think . tonight , movie displace Dungeons and Dragons bad movie ever personally see movie theater ( do notcount movie go see expectation be bad , such Plan 9 etc. ) . same time , raise grand total movie almost walk out two ( D&D ; be other one ) . do notwalk out movie , noteven one , but should have when first see visual depiction aura , New Age BS keep get thick and thick point on.The plot be about group people involve old prophecy , quest spiritual enlightenment and aim bring mankind next step its evolution . or something . actually talk spiritual stuff be next step human evolution , which should make anybody who have even faint idea what human evolution be cringe . movie be shock full whopper . occasionally people beam what would certainly describe " dimension " , or perhaps " plane " , only become invisible who have n't yet reach enlightenment . Goodness.At end director patronize audience roll " insight " make up prophecy , painfully slow , presumably so can memorize and leave cinema good , more enlightened individuals.Good thing movie ? very pretty nature shot , and decent support performance Elizondo and de Almeida.I honestly can say seriously affect my ability take person seriously consider movie interesting or acceptable . really be el cheapo spiritualism most naive kind , and that be your thing , better do something else your time and money .
Van Damme . what else can say ? Bill Goldberg . there WE Go . now know movie be go be really horrible.I see first five minute movie TBS , know would be bad . but noteven think would be This bad . plot be awful , Van Damme be get old ( finally ) , but Arnold , his movie be as well.Forget movie . do n't see . ever . would n't even be pay see film.1/5 star - its heart lie wonderful , action-packed thrill ride.Well , maybe not, but marketer would sure like think so , would n't ?

be impossible objectively consider movie . nothave n't try , mind - but sit down , and pop age VBS , and watch opening ... and suddenly be five year old again and clutch my very own Care Bear and watch movie open eye and eager heart.I can see , objectively , movie be BIZARRE combination cuddly baby merchandising-mascots and creepy prepubescent child evil power that have thin story and uninteresting animation . but my inner five-year-old go , " Yay ! Care Bears ! " time think . so - will only ( cautiously , reluctantly ) recommend movie who see their early youth and can call awesome power nostalgia watch ( ) OR lovably cynical Gen-X/Y-ers who deliberately seek out wonderfully bad/strange ( category which movie ... definitely belong ) . actually look compelling movie or wholesome family entertainment : might want keep look .
Well , TiVo record Angelina Jolie . have 2.5 star . seem promise . go downhill fast.There be much overact , even Angelina . be about 20 and play 16 year old . there be three character that be suppose be Italian . everyone else be Italian- American . native Italian accent be good , think . young male lead be cute , my wife say . everyone else movie be fat Italian woman . even men.I should have know when Dick Van Patten be cast randy doctor , that that be bad sign . two couple chase their kid around be four Italian Stooges.My wife would notlet go remote . hopefully be nottake makeup , clothing or decorate tip . be sick and twisted combination hideous and garish . be hidegarishous.Cutting off my left ventricle be notsufficient distract pain watch movie . movie show up your TV , do favor and ram your head TV screen instead . will be glad do . only movie have ever see that be bad be " Hamburger : movie " . or maybe " Deadly Friend " .
be just terrible movie . one should waste their time . go see something else . movie be , doubt , one bad movie have ever see my life . want see good movie , do n't see make man .
film be so bad be good . be clearly notone . base true story , film be about as true story Pinocchio 's chance become real boy . act be terrible , direction be poor , and travel way too fast . be as director just want get over and do and go home.Nor do Melissa Joan Hart ever strike talented actress , but then film make be pretty low-budget anyway . most her other film , let down her character ham up too much , talk too quickly as speed up her word be go make more dramatic . really bring out sense there be crew front and be talk camera , when should be engage viewer her character . pretty much let down whole film , and leg may have have leave stand , be ruined.Probably only good thing film be when get nail end . but even that be n't satisfy enough subdue my loathing such bad film.Watch your taste film be bland piece dry toast .
describe film garbage be unfair . least root garbage can be absorbing hobby . flick be neither absorb nor entertaining.Kevin Bacon can act superbly give chance , so doubt have IRS bill settle when agree dire screenplay . mad scientist story ' Hollow Man ' have be tell , be tell well , and be tell resort so many ludicrously expensive special effects.Most special effect seem be build transparent anatomical doll man , woman and dog could buy early seventy . UK be market ' Transparent Man ( /Woman/Dog ) ' which be maybe where get title film.Clever special effect , dire script , non-existent plot .
be completely appall see average rating movie be 5.negative what affect , be definitely one bad movie have ever see and still keep wonder why watch end . first , plot be totally hopeless , and act truly awful . think totally unknown actress would have be good role Susan Lucci ; concern Mr. Kamar Del 's Reyes , think would have be good choice remain his " Valley Dolls " . sum up , be total waste time(and i be try stay polite ... ) avoid cost . my rating be 1 and still think be well pay , but can give O ... .

 Yeah , Madsen 's character - talk woman TV station - be right : LAPD be corrupt , violent and racist police . and movie change nothing . okay , here be good cop , moral cop , even black one , whow , Christian , martyr . but be fairy tale , admit . reality be not. and most important action fan : shoot out be boring . be just shoot and shoot and shoot . nothing more . Play Counter Strike , then will least have something do . only moral film be : LAPD be good now . more bad cop . like uncritical , euphemistic commercial police and military service , watch movie . be long commercial have ever see . ( 2 Points camera and edit ) .
have give film 1 be bad , but do n't make think do n't enjoy watch , laugh and laugh , and even have few question . half time be laugh , half time be say " what hell be go on ? " or " why would someone do ? " et cetera . mostly enjoy terrible fog effect , 80 's style nude scene/battle/dialogue/nude scene , and way warrior 's sword flap wind when ride their horse . and there be crappy model effect ( be n't suppose be real tree , be ? ) and still do n't understand guy find cave , what hell be ? friend tell movie and think would give em try , and basically like film people Ed Wood film , have real enjoyment what film be mean be , look my own hilarious way . so do n't let distract really think be action movie , be , just like other reason . be much , much bad Evil Dead , so can actually make think as be waste your life watch ( which come my mind few time ) . guess good thing most people would be have few drink , have friend around , and laugh film . maybe be bit harsh , but do n't think so , rent and will see . Yo .
unfortunately movie be more concerned make lame social commentary real event , but doesnt have ball legitimately document what happen . constant rhetoric how violent video game be notblame ( get impression Ben Coccio be avid game ) , or how medium and music be completely devoid influence be obvious message ( even get laughable scene two boy burn ALL their cd be , talk subtlety ! ) , but movie only get away its ' fiction ' . nice try . yes its great idea relieve medium influence , but how do know kid that have actually plan and execute school shooting werent influence medium ? or video game ? dont , and wont movie once again kid be smart enough completely relinquish medium , yet dumb enough scorch Nazi symbol ground ? haha somehow dont think so.The movie bat head its portrayal normalcy family , its almost do disservice think there be n't serious flaw family dynamic kid that have actually go out and shoot their fellow schoolmate . why be everyone so concern make killer seem " normal " , when be so obviously not? completely false and phony depiction .
see film history Channel today ( 2006 ) . first , realize be notdocumentary -- be drama . but , might hope least critical " fact " story turn might be base actual event . Reagan be shoot and other character be real people . movie get right . there on , reliance fact rapidly decay . have never hear movie see . have be TV reporter time event , be stun have never hear anything bizarre behavior Secretary Haig as portray Richard Dreyfuss . whole nation have hear " be control ... " , etc. , but Dreufuss ' Haig be bully cower cabinet and totally out control personally . have watch film , begin research subject Internet and quickly find actual audio tape and transcript most Situation Room conversation film pretend reenact . incredibly , many principal " fact " film mean show White House , Secret Service etc. total chaos -- and nation 's leadership behave irrationally and drive world brink nuclear war -- be demonstrably incorrect . do n't happen ! there be internal conflict , be sure . Haig make misstep , his press room performance be historically regrettable and be " difficult " . but there be nothing approach scene depict film . there be too many gross error list , but fair comparison record and write record and fantasy film beg question what producer be really try accomplish . enlighten ? inform ? entertain ? believe fail three front . be difficult ascribe motive other , but must seriously question what be behind such shameless invention . and , as my beloved history Channel 's " Reel real " follow-on documentary , there be almost mention issue that be central focus film -- namely event administration day shooting . so , viewer be leave research much -- -- help network .
film be noteven worth walking movie theatre . joke , but stupid and boring laugh repeated disgusting stuff . music and girl be great , unfortunately have watch whole movie enjoy . be weak , very very weak .
First , let say be LDS or rather , be Mormon . so when watch film , automatically give benefit doubt . can usually find something redeem movie watch . and one be exception . do have its redeeming moment . but be few and far between.One first thing notice bother very greatly be seem as Halestorm be ashamed our church ! LDS Church , congregation be call " ward " and basketball court be " cultural hall " . never once be either two name mention . Church be never refer name and " standard " be as far go mention what our Church believes.It make wonder director be really LDS or LDS wannabe ? film have so much potential ! could have really show our church positive light and help public see notonly what have offer , but also what believe . instead be only mildly entertaining and leave much be desire . be notalready LDS , will be leave think Mormon be stupid , idiotic and ashamed their beliefs.It be notfilm will recommend my nonLDS friends.Sorry Halestorm . can do good !
have be familiar fantastic book ' Goodnight Mister Tom ' absolutely age and be only recently when get chance watch adaption . have hear lot positive remark , so have high hope . once film have finish , be horrified.This film be notgood film . ' Goodnight Mister Tom ' be extremely poor adaption and practically 4.negative book be miss out . particularly , find lot character and great scene book be not. there be notmuch dialogue , be rush and far too fast-moving , but be mostly upset fact never get see bond and love William Beech and Tom film which be true let down . casting be notall good,either . think could have be really good , but be so different book ! Anextremely poor adaption , one bad have see . deserve decent remake that will well be 1000 time well pile garbage .
least be able enjoy mock movie which be surprising be barely able sit . honesty , my guess be cover DVD case cost more entire movie . and say be same director Boogeyman , when new version that just come out ... nice touch guy , be mislead enough rope . only thing that frustrate more insufferable acting copycat be his haircut . usually only see kind hair ten year old boy and character act . film look be shoot D+ grad student film school excite use film technique ever learn attend class ... .sometimes , less be more buddy . would get lose random plot twist that lead nowhere or be unexplained . all make bad movie but when ending do n't even come close pull together , well , that make exceptionally bad movie . doubt be bad movie have ever see , and that include my friend ' French final video senior year high school , but hey maybe i be bit bias , mean do get play extra . P.S. do n't even think deserve star ... noteven half . none ! !
seem evident adaptation do not. notonly do leave plot behind , make up his own ! thing choose leave be so ridiculously unbelievable be happy choose leave out most important part novel . plot be hazy , inconsistent and choppy say least . do n't want say anything mean-spirited actor , but ca n't act ! Dickens be difficult , course , but be pathetic ! Micawber be nothing more mid-nineteenth century Kramer , and less say Betsy Trotwood well ! want see real Copperfield , watch wonderful 1999 BBC adaptation . as screenplay writer,I think read Cliff 's note !
" Secretary " be one cheesy , cliched , " thriller " be subject watch Sunday afternoon , when there be virtually nothing else . plot ( demented woman become jealous who succeed office and decide do whatever can stop ) may be one kind , recognize countless plot twist , probably take other TV movie have be subject very same reason.To make matter worse , be notwild cast . Mel Harris be one actress who appear so many TV movie either " mom " or sort " victim " foul play or abuse , that must wonder kind life lead . one , get joy play mom and victim psycho secretary Sheila Kelly , who be notvery good choice villain . Sheila Kelly have make good career moves(Singles , break , and guess , Law and Order ) , be also beset string pitiful TV movie role , and one just add . as other , do n't have clear memory , that must say something.This one Will play Lifetime network(I think be where see ) , but do n't bother watch , be too bore word . notwill make more excitied ...
My God , be " Run , Lola , Run " adaptation Persuasion ? be horrible . bad enough " screenwriter " ( and use term very loosely ) cut and paste dialogue one character , often completely context and rush story along : but Anne Elliott run location location pursuit Wentworth end piece be abomination ! Austen must be spin her grave . respectable young woman would have act such atrocious fashion . and actress that play Mary ? horror . needless say , rest Austen remake be bad , will be turn off new generation watchers.If want see impeccable version ( otherwise ) wonderful novel , get 1995 Roger Michell direct version star Amanda Root ( whose expression alone can speak volume ) and Ciaran Hinds . be superb .
movie be so bad , be comical . fact , Mystery Science Theatre 3000 , television show which three character watch and parody bad movie , use very film mock . suggest watch ( maybe YouTube ) instead actually see movie.Please , do notsee Hobgoblins be notprepare stop first scene . actually , do notsee movie , period . please . least notseriously . its joke be notfunny ( say least ) , and will have much more fun parody or watch parody then view movie.You may feel become sick watch , so spare . read book . do laundry . anything be more fun watch Hobgoblins .
movie still chill bone think . movie be notjust bad low-budget , badly act , etc. certainly WAS all thing . problem movie be seem be intentionally try annoy viewer , and do great success . what want know be , be suppose be horror movie ? mean , be definately horrify , but notway horror movie be suppose be . could see first segment try be horror and fail , but what hell be second segment ? be just annoy . third segment be watch artsy student film , which amazingly enough make least painful segment . be atrocity movie be n't way low bottom 100 , so get your vote ( negative ) people ! ! know people give good review , but , well , be lie sadistic attempt trick . trust , be impossible like movie . only benefit movie be amazing life-extending effect : feel have be watch movie year only first half hour have pass .
be incredible that succeed be terrible so many level . script , acting , directing and choice cast be all appalling . costume , set and pseudo-medieval language be also utterly awful . odd way actually enjoy film , once have accept be n't go be good . seem shame people would spend so much time and effort produce something so poor , when really could have make something pretty decent premise ( notvery believable ! ) , but instead be treat rather nauseate and cheesy tale dragon and knight , that lack charm be find other such fantasy film . Let 's just hope Lord Rings be bit well ! oh , and David Thewlis ' haircut make look He-Man . do !
just watch movie last night , and Had put warning out anybody else consider see film . word - do n't . seriously feel be something screenwriting student would have write Quentin Tarantino/Eddie Murphy phase , i.e. other word be curse word . do n't have problem profuse curse , as " Good Will Hunting " , provide help delve more character . case be just hollow banter attempt draw occassional *gasp* or laughter audience . three lead character be all their own unique stereotype , wall street jerk , coffee house jerk , and " I'm-Not-Gay-Just-In-Touch-With-My-Feminine-Side " slightly-less-of-a-jerk . just do n't give damn ! be all shallow , unredemable loser who Want see lose . who dare , film do have couple funny moment , very beginning , and very end . toilet/vibrator scene be funny sick kinda " Uh , yeah " way . really though , would only recommend film my bad enemy .
Cliff Robertson scheming husband marry rich wife deliver razzie-worthy performance here there ever be one ; be as director Michael Anderson keep yell " dial down ; think zombie , only less lively " his little bullhorn coach Robertson 's effort . rest cast be barely good ; Jennifer Agutter Logan 's RUN fame be hardly see what should have be flesh out pivotal role . quality act be three time well ; more gape plot hole be fill ; and pace be give shot adrenaline , then yawner might be bring up standard acceptable Hallmark\Lifetime TV channel crowd . as be , its rating be so inexplicably high ca n't help think chronic insomniac be use Dominique catch little snooze time . perhaps late-night TV telemarketer be miss major opportunity notshilling as such .

absolutely bad film yet Burton , who seem be get bad film direct . miserable script load clich be only first many objectionable aspect film . be kind movie where time something happen , will be sure hear someone shout " have lose his gun ! " or whatever be let everybody know . Carter be really awful and so be Wahlberg , who ca n't play straight and be convincing . very nice effect and photography , but poor music John Williams mold Burton 's crony Elfman . Heston appear nonsensichal scene spout out his most famous catch-phrases first movie . very poor results.If anyone else there also see " Sleepy Hollow " , will probably have notice , have , decline quality Burton 's film . have hear particular project be produce other and Burton be bring director , which case his judgement should be question . but think have allow possible vision might have have earlier his career slip ; evidence be there film . " Sleepy Hollow " , could n't decide what kind movie be make , be comedy or real horror movie , and population British character actor ( Chris Lee , etc. ) make also think be kind monster rally film ( be never scary , horror fan know ) . movie could n't succeed horror or comedy be so schizophrenic , and style have be develop smooth two together . " planet Apes " be much same way , and result come off more " Total Recall " or " Tango and Cash " sci-fi . be also fall rut so many other " big " director try satisfy entire possible audience . word Burton , be out there -- pick something and do straight , or use style peice together ( " Mars Attacks " or " Beetlejuice " ) or might as well retire , people that be fan your movie will stop go .
would like say curiosity get good . only see trailer , will be able tell whole plot movie ; could have save most pointless one hour and forty minute my entire life , and about twenty dollar . movie be disaster wait happen , and be embarrassment Hollywood.The movie display vivid ignorance reality . example , kid 's remote control race car go neighborhood , and even enter house . be even cover clothes . be notrational believe remote can no longer transmit signal circumstance ? Hollywood obviously do notbelieve so . common logic and concept electronics dictate opposite ; doubt race car could even have reach street , let alone house street . unrealistic trait be lack intelligence criminal possess . why be all movie , criminal be rocket scientist encounter eight-year old ? kid be mean be most intelligent person movie instead professional terrorist ? please , there be more reality Matrix . also , leader put down his real pistol and " accidentally " pick up plastic pistol ; apparently , could nottell difference . even glove , should be able do . just look same do notmean anything ; there be other sense then sight . traps be unrealistic well ; one actually work , criminal would be dead . but , Hollywood intend " laugh " " funny " result traps . do notlaugh ; sigh and roll my eyes.But , recommend movie anyone who think have see really bad movie ; movie see will seem Citizen Kane compare one . otherwise , skip one sake your pride . Home Alone 3 also raise question . all know Alex D. Linz star movie , but do write as well ?
have suspicion movie be go be bad . be Duke 's fan way back . have three year TV series DVD . well be right . take family see . really want see General jump again and chase jump scene be good . but sum up , movie be dumbed down tarted up version TV show.Jessica Simpson be pathetic . can honestly say original Daisy 's outfits be just as revealing , Jessica Simpson 's interpretation Daisy be simply awful . Sorrel Booke and Denver Pyle must be roll their grave well.Do n't waste your money . be old tried and true Dukes fan and my three kid be will be very disappoint .
This be bad adaption classic story have ever see . needlessly modernize and point be actually just sick.The song rarely move story . seem be throw random . fly scene Marley be pointless and ludicrous.It be notonly one bad movie have see , but be definitely bad musical have ever seen.It be probably only consider classic " Christmas Carol " be such classic story . just original story be classic do n't mean cheap adaption be .
do n't use word " awful " describe work cinema which great deal time , effort , talent and money be spend its creation but Zefferelli 's attempt adapt Charlotte Bront 's novel ' Jane Eyre ' be total waste time.The script be lack finesse and power , everything explain viewer uncertain term , leave little imagination . lead actor be woefully miscast , clearly hire their star name , and musical score drippy and dull . Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt have absolutely chemistry one . be wet noodle , worse even Joan Fontaine , who least be capable modicum emotional involvement what should be story frustrated passion . and William Hurt act entire film one tone and tone be flat and devoid energy . course limp and vapid script do notaid otherwise fine actor their effort bring whiff life flick.Joan Plowright 's Mrs Fairfax be Disney creation who keep pop up sweeten scene which would have be well leave out.There be mystery surround story Rochester 's first wife . role would-be second wife , play Barbie Doll Elle MacPhearson , be empty cipher.Fiona Shaw , very great actress , be completely waste Jane 's Aunt , Mrs Reed . would have be better-cast Mrs Fairfax . only Amanda Root , Jane 's beloved school teacher , evoke authentic sympathy or believability.I see version ' Jane Eyre ' view Robert Young 's British television , make 1997 , star Ciaran Hinds , Samantha Morgan and Gemma Jones . there be comparison . Young 's vital , romantic and deeply move version be explode nova compare Zefferelli 's wet squib.I will be interested now see 1970 version Timothy Dalton , which have read very good thing web-site . be amaze how many people like Zefferelli 's Yorkshire picture book.About all can say good film be house be beautiful and cinematography vividly color , that be complete dud .
would highly recommend see movie . view , will be able walk out other bad movie EVER say " least be n't Omega Code."Forget my money , want my time back !
spoiler ! ! love Branagh , love Helena Bonham-Carter , love together " Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein " - but This -I can understand actor 's desire stretch , avoid romantic stereotype . well , do , but really - script drone , Bonham-Carter 's clothes be Tre chic , and occasional speeded-up " madcap " sequence could have be outtake Beatles ' movie , or old Rowan and Martin Laugh-In.I never get point - other commenter say Branagh character be dreamer . never feel . be loser , and notvery bright , and certainly notendear . business bank robber disguise be merely painful watch . certainly notamusing.Bonham-Carter be realistic ( one suppose ) attempt realistic speech be hard understand first 15 minute Lancashire accent " Full Monty."The poetic ending , high hill her bury monstrosity his airplane be too orchestrate . be there choir angel , or merely soundtrack ? go back classic or something spine and arc . donate PBS .

horribly pointless and , bad , boring film . stranger Fiction have nothing new say anything , character most unimaginative stereotype , and rely clunky central concept that be particularly original nor deal vaguely innovative way.Will Ferrell be totally waste what presumably hope be his answer Jim Carey 's Truman Show , and substitute his usual shouting routine ( admittedly very funny discount Talledega Nights ) , well , pretty much nothing.Emma Thompson be no more mildly irritate ( review have read here be talk up Oscar nomination be laughable ) Maggie Gyllenhaal do passable job very weak script that allow nothing establish her character former law student who drop out Harvard become baker like make people happy . please . end up fall Ferrell 's ' character ' be utterly ludicrous.Marc Forster 's attempt jazz up film use computer graphics only serve highlight uninspired material have work with.I have choice either go watch Prestige third time or see . wish have opt Prestige .

movie be make fan Dani ( and Cradle Filth ) . be notone . think be just imitator ride black metal bandwagon ( still , be generally notfan black metal ) . but be carry DVD case pay , convince , less authentic something be more try be convincing . thus assume be roller-coaster ride rubber gore and do-it-yourself splatter sinister background . now , that be what do like.I get home and pop in . my patience last 15 minute . awful camera work and DISGUSTING quality . and be then ( 2002 ) , that look be shoot use Hi8 camcorder . leave shelf . maybe nice evening beer and Bmovies would create nice setting ... picture.After couple month get back ( mention surroundings ) and see half . then notonly mention aspect annoy . my dislike evolve . notice how funny Dani ( 1,65m ; 5'5 " height ) look his platform shoe rip head mugger apart . ( yes , ripping . his head apparently have skull . ) also find movie may have sense . still , have n't finish yet , so be n't positive.After couple more try finally manage finish flick - couple month back ... ( Yes , take 5,5 year . ) so - Dani fact be funny Satan/Manson/super-evil-man 's Helper and movie DID notmake sense . see our bad person employ Dani do bad thing . deliver . why ? well guess be just very , very bad . matter fact be and be pretty much it.We have couple short story join Dani 's character . my favourite be about guy , who STEALS SOMEONE 's LEG , want use his own . yeah , exactly.The acting 's Rock Bottom . CGI be bad ever . mean Stinger beat ( and , boy , be Stinger 's CGI baaaaad ) . story have sense . and quality be ... Let 's just say be notsatisfying . only thing that might keep watch be unmotivated violence and gore . blood and gut be make pretty well . why , can actually see movie originate there and then move on . ( example - Dani ' The Man ' Filth take stuffed cat - fake as can be - and gut ... and then eat what fall out . why ? never know . do know , however , cat must have be illegal substance , his heart be almost half his size.)You might think , my comment movie be so bad be good , but be just bad . cradle Filth fan can add 3 point . add one gore .
movie that follow struggle actor , play , evidently , struggling actor , do favour Chris Klein . struggle bring anything memorable role and meander shallow script manage display , what could only be describe as , bland lead man . story exist , but be , and fail show basic start , middle and end and viewer be left shrug his shoulder feel nothing past hour and three quarter have really happened.One bright light midst be Fred Durst , who manage stand out his seemingly averagely talented co-star and do semi-decent job bring backward character Legde life . Fred can re-create when work high calibre cast remain be see but I'l be watch out future .

sun be notshine , be too wet play , so go movie , that cold , cold , wet date day."The Cat Hat " be name flick , and when be over , my stomach be sick.Mike Myers play Cat , his humor be lame , and kid need n't see , humor be nottame.the film be drinking milk , rabid cow , so be fun have fun , yet filmmaker do n't know how.This film , short be atrocious . act be bad , plot be tweak too much , and humor be surprisingly very crude.It start Conrad and Sally , rule breaker and future sheriff . when their Mother have go work , get Mrs. Kwan babysit . possibly lone funny part movie be when Mrs. Kwan be watch Taiwanese court room , ` la C-SPAN . soon fall asleep , and here come Cat.The film start spiral out control . Cat come try let kid have fun . have get Thing 1 and Thing 2 , who suddenly start trash house . improvise TV Infomercial , and accidentally slice his tail off . and when Cat go full Carmen Miranda , be notfunny . possibly his only funny disguise be as hippie activist . and there be fish who try warn kid Cat.Too bad do n't warn film be as much fun sour milk , or chop your tail off.Soon kid be outside look family dog , who have key crate his collar . crate be notlock soon , their house will be home Cat 's universe . here get little more interesting , but notenough save film.The act , overall , be horrible . Mike Meyers bring his brand irreverent Austin Powers humor Cat , say thing " dirty ho " and imagine woman rest his life whack testicle pose pinata . Spencer Breslin be great trouble-making Conrad , and Dakota Fanning be cute Sally , alone be notenough save horrendous aortic dissection wait kill John Ritter(accident wait happen ) . Alec Baldwin 's slick and slimey Lawrence Quinn be disgusting , ever try woo kid mom , who be play Kelly Preston . and Sean Hayes be Mr. Humberfloob , Mom 's boss , and be also voice fish . latter three be also bland.Overall , be parent would nottake my kid who be potty humor , cause there be plenty and more . save your $7.00 and see something else . late great Dr. Seuss said,It be fun have fun , but have know how . really , Universal , stop ! Theodore be already turn over his grave.Like my Mom always say , " Curiousity kill Cat".- The Cat The Hat * out *****
This be sad movie woman who think her ex who love so much be probably dead , but really his scientist dad have just put spell turn really cute shark-guy . kind like Beauty and beast . could probably use ballroom dance scene and maybe singing candlestick , but there be pretty gross plant instead . make one girl really itchy , so let get eat shark-guy instead scratch whole movie . scientist guy be good dad who try reunite his fishy shark son woman be engage , even arrange have private time s-e-x , but woman be really shallow snob and think shark-guy be ugly , icky monster and want nothing do . give up love ! just be shark ! think be pretty sad how all have do be kiss and will turn back normal and will live happily ever , but be notkind movie .
movie start out ordinary comic-hero-movie . its about boy who be pick , have parent and be madly love school #1 girl . nothing surprise movie , there be nothing cant guess come movie . Toby Mcguire show either be good actor or actor world can save script one . maybe kid age ten can enjoy film but be bit violent young . cant get away think movie X-men , Batman and Spawn . title be good . almost walk out last 20 minute ! One thing that could have be good though be computeranimation , But noteven be anything put Christmas-tree ! my recomendation : Dont see film even get pay !
My comment be Russian version Space Race name Bitva za Kosmos ( Battle Space ) show Russia 's First Channel April 10-13 , 2006 . bad translation could have ruin detail but doubt be case . number factual error be such be impossible list , especially first episode ( development first missile ) . even U.S. half film contain multiple error and omission . audience be nottell V-2/A-4 launch U.S. Three different Jupiter C rocket be launch same serial number ' UE ' onboard . Apollo 1 be be launch Moon , etc. Russian half , and person be ludicrous . Korolev be scare NKVD , Glushko be saboteur and traitor , Mishin be alcoholic etc. man function ; motivation , life . uniform and decoration be awful . Gagarin sing frivolous song await launch ( think be add specially Russian version ) .

Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy have extensive ( separate ) film career be eventually team . many Ollie 's pre-Stan film , be bill screen Babe Hardy ... and his adult life , Hardy be know his friend as ' Babe ' . tour postwar Britain Laurel music-hall act Bernard Delfont , Hardy give interview journalist John McCabe which explain origin nickname : early his acting career , Hardy get shave gay hairdresser who squeeze Hardy 's plump cheek ( one his face ) and say ' Nice baby ! ' Hardy 's workmates start cry ' Babe ' , and nickname stuck.Although much Hardy 's pre-Laurel work be very interesting -- notably his comedy role support Larry Semon and Chaplin imitator Billy West -- his teamwork Billy Ruge ( who ? ) series low-budget short Vim Comedy Film Company be very dire indeed . Hardy and Ruge be give screen name Plump and Runt : name which be unpleasant their own right , but make bad Ruge ( short Hardy ) be n't especially runt . see here , Hardy look much do his early Hal Roach film Laurel ... but spit curl and fastidious little moustache.'One Too Many ' , absolutely typical Plunt and Runt epic , be direly unfunny ... and its dreichness be make even more conspicuous fact film have exactly same premise ' be my wife ' , one Laurel and Hardy 's most hilarious film . Plump ( Hardy ) be star boarder rooming-house run tall gawky landlady . runt ( Ruge ) be porter . Plump receive letter his wealthy uncle John , whose dosh expect inherit . his uncle be come see and meet Plump 's wife and baby . there be only one problem : Plump have n't get wife and baby . have be lie his uncle order seem family man . now , course , Plump expect Runt find wife and baby short notice . course , result be disastrous . would be nice disastrous result be funny , but be n't . most unfunny humour here be just empty slapstick , character settle their argument shove other bathtubs.SPOILERS COMING . vim director Will Louis ( who ? ) show instinct camera framing : actress who play landlady be significantly tall Hardy , and Louis consistently set up his shot so her head be out frame . could be funny do purpose , but be merely inept . one point bad comedy , extremely tasteless gag be loom horizon Runt approach black laundress . ' surely would n't stoop THAT low laugh , ' think . but do . runt steal woman 's black infant and try fob off Plump 's progeny.Somehow , Plump acquire infant 's cot , but still have n't get baby . Uncle John come up stair , Plump conscript Runt babyhood . gag might just possibly have work midget , or even truly runt-sized actor such Chester Conklin , but Billy Ruge be only slightly average height . Ruge 's impersonation baby be neither believable nor funny , and Uncle John would have be complete moron fall . amazingly , do ! most notable aspect ' too many ' be brief appearance -- apparently her only-ever film appearance -- Madelyn Saloshin , Oliver Hardy 's first wife . marriage be nothappy one , Hardy 's marital trouble never attain epic proportion Stan Laurel's.Only one thing movie impress . there be very brief flashback sequence , Hardy reminisce his seaside romance bath beauty . 1916 , there be still notyet standard film grammar convey flashback : one show here be do gracefully and simply . too bad movie have other merit . ' One too many ' be definitely one film too many Oliver Hardy 's CV , and will rate movie just one point out 10 . Laurel and Hardy together be definitely much funny either separately .

This be single bad movie have ever see . let say again : be Single WORST Movie I Have EVER SEEN.It have ear-marks bad movie : continuity error , bad writing , bad acting , bad production value , bad music . think there be couple point horror movie . first be be suppose be suspenseful enough scare . movie get and F category . second point be when character die , or something bad happen , be suppose care . movie get F regard well.The first story , woman get maul wolf be afraid would happen . next story , OCD guy die notbe careful and talk dead friend his . oh , and then there be horrific , nail-biting story bad roommate . come , could pick topic little more interesting and little less common be alone house , be anal-retentive , and have roommate ? turn out story where hallucination , virtual reality induce Doctor who turn use . wow , stupid.Let explain something , enjoy watch bad horror movie and laugh how bad be . could n't do one . be utter pain sit and watch . do notcircumstance watch movie . Will regret .
have agree most everyone 's opinion show be poorly produce as well written.The acting be notmuch more low production value however feel actor can only rely material provide and make good . keep thought feel be important point out one actor have rise and persevere well campy tasteless production have become respectable and quite talented performer.I be refer Laura Harris Canadian bear actor who have etch her way poorly produce show and movie find place HBO hit " Dead Me " where play role Daisy Adair and her credit handle role efficient manner.I remember have typical boyhood crush young actress series where play Ashley soft spoken yet intelligent 7th grader.I feel as though anyone might " make " series surely would be Laura Harris and true her nature do excel act field win respect many producer who now recognize her talent as well unique Nordic blond allure . ever do have opportunity view series recommend have something epic watch ward such ' Godfather ' or perhaps ' Beaches ' order remind there be all great deal true production integrity and value there and series be only low-budget reminder what Laura Harris can simply state her time show and bet would quote many young actor word defense say " be start ! "

just see film yesterday.My girlfriend want see only Richard Gere.I feel waste my time and money and tell my girlfriend be last time go see film just certain actor/actress be . hope learn lesson have trouble keep her seat . as , pay already , want see end least , just hope something good would turn up , but do n't hold my breath , and luckily so cause would have be victim film just same.This be notblack and white film , be black and black one . main character ( Richard Gere ) be almost as bad his registrant , and sex offender be portray unredeemable hard core criminal and bad one be really very very bad . speak clich and exploitation typical US phobia.Richard Gere 's acting be good usual but blond girl that be suppose replace be wishy washy good . totally unconvincing job.The film try exploit popular theme and give cheap , dramatic , and sensational turn that just be unreal . just use sex offender excuse indulge cheap violent act murder , vigilante beating , rape and torture - something that almost seem gratuitous . even have wolf attack people film - how low can get.I gather film wo n't come out USA and will go straight DVD . be be should have stay other country too , but 's Hollywood and Richard Gere just have show . believe , Gere , film be noteven worth B-series movie .
have write least half dozen scathing review abysmal little flick and none get publish , so must opine someone imdb.com really like awful movie . idea bunch oilman can resurrect military tank that have set desert decade , and make fight machine again be ludicrous . so be acting and direction . pass .

Very VERY Bad MOVIE.*My rate : negative -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
I be very disappoint film few reason . first half hour be actually pretty decent . acting be n't well then which would find rap video , its kinda funny and production value do n't seem bad . fact almost think would be almost as good Perico Ripiao ( recent Dominican film ) which turn out be Much Much well expect . plot movie revolve around notjust cheat husband but how woman be view and treat Dominican society whole , which make good premise especially Dominican Republic . unfortunately do n't think maker film rely good movie be all about how treat your subject matter , and f'ing butcher veal cutlet have . about 30 minute movie role man and woman be reverse main character wife put kind spell result his cheating habit . notonly do transition happen what look be cut edge , space age , CGI effect date what be guess would be 70 be , but whole plot just go down drain . rest movie be nothing but cheesy predictable situation , and clever one liner . top off ( and guess should warn now **SPOILER ALERT** ) all turn out be dream . oh my who do n't see come ? oh man almost forget most ridiculous thing movie . well hour start think " hmmmm something just do n't seem right sound track but what can be ? ? " and then hit Half Music Movie WAS TAKEN From A Video Game CALLED King FIGHTER 95.When oh when DR will give film can call work art ? ! ? ! perhaps comedy match France 's Amelie , or action flick match Thailand 's Ong-Bak , animation Akira be Japan , witty crime thriller Layer Cake be England , or socio-awakening journey Waking Life have here state ... .i would give 1 but i have see much worse come out DR , search Los Jodedores and will know what be talk about .
Annie Potts be only highlight truly dull film . Mark Hamill play teenager who be really really really upset someone steal corvette and his classmate turn hotrod ( quite possibly ugly look car be feature movie ) , and head off Las Vegas Annie track down evil genius who have steal his pride and joy.I would have pluck out my eye watch be n't fun watch Annie Potts very early role , and be too bad Hamill do n't take few acting lesson . Danny Bonaduce also make goofy cameo .
will be blunt . be notone politically correct movie where woman play bad ass who be notgo take crap anyone . one cast member want , could have just take out heartbeat . be entertaining MST 3K , but do n't rent real version . trust . have ever lie ?
National Lampoon be once funny magazine . like stone hippie day late sixty or smug and sassy coke-head day seventy ( when comedy be fortify plenty naked babe ) depend very much your date birth , but everyone agree early eighty , middle age have kill whichever remaining spark anarchic humour drug have n't , and offering film and increasingly terrible spin-off record shoot further hole hull . nicely illustrate title sequence , there be absolutely nothing recommend singularly depressing stinkbug . make baffle opening segment , ' grow Myself ' , hope thing will get good , tough luck - do n't . whoever think idea woman be brutally rape stick butter be comedy gold deserve have his head hand back platter dog mess . there be ever global shortage guitar pick , negative ramble , incoherent ragbag crummy idea and dire performance may well serve purpose .
No spoiler here but have be fan Waking Dead start but last series , which only 3 have be so far be awful . story bear resemblance original idea series . find 3 last series jaw droppingly ludicrous . BBC licence payer , show ring BBC complaint pass my disappointment . be amaze actor calibre Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone do n't object story line . actor have be character 8 season , surly can see be lose direction . be good job be last series or next series may start team investigate death Father Christmas ! Paul Bentley , West Yorkshire , England .
 Evidently when offer actor enough money will do anything . be notsure how much John Rys-Daves get , but most money make should go his fan apology even be associate such ROTTEN movie . special effect be bad then effect 1950 's B movie and acting rest cast be even bad . how bad act be child give second good performance my opinion . English be terribly accent and think one could really even speak English just memorize how word should sound instead memorize script and try make their character both " life-like " and real .
really want like Pillow Book . intriguing story , interesting character outline , Ewan Macgregor utterly glorious altogether . unfortunately , hate minute . Greenaway get so enamoured present movie uniquely , and notfilm 's benefit . wo n't even get Vivian Wu 's abysmal acting.You get distract story 4 billion teeny window and calligraphy that roll bottom screen display lyric music that be play . seem lose sight present actual story and develop plot , and get entangled foo-foo embellishment that have nothing do anything . be bit present John Singer Sargeant portrait chintzy Hallmark frame that say " GRANDMA Loves Me ! " big sparkly letters.This movie seem be casualty director auteur 's ego instead what could have be - disturbingly and horrifyingly beautiful . director 's hand ( Jeunet ? Coppola ? ) , could have be masterpiece . Greenaway 's hand , be well relegate fine art class that also take too seriously .
really , everybody movie look want be someplace else ! wonder , casting be do notleft hand , but rather not. have n't see anything bad Natascha McElhone impersonate sort agent , carry gun . do n't use spoiled city-brat-look such role . only bad thing can imagine be cast Doris Day prostitute . rest cast be likewise awful , possibly Hurt sole exception , sometimes can see try , but suffering . oh , do mention be completely insane story ? jeopardize many people live be divorce and want see your family ? well , must be guy ( Weller ) be German ? negative , photography could be bad .
A dog find local kennel be mate Satan and have litter puppy , one which be give family who have just lose their previous dog hit & run . puppy want time make Donald Trump and fire Mexican housekeeper , how festive . only father suspect canine be more then appear , rest family love demonic pooch . so be up dad say day.This late 70 be make TV horror flick have little go misplace feeling nostalgia . when see kid find be tense nail-biter , but revisit adult now realize be merely lame,boring , and notreally well-act least bit.My Grade : D

Fassbinder have make bad film , sure do n't want see ! anyone who complain his film be too talky and claustrophobic should be force view , learn appreciate more spare style opt excellent film " Bitter Tears Petra von Kant " . film bogs down so much arty , quasi-symbolic image look parody " art-film " . scene slaughterhouse and scene where Elvira 's prostitute friend channel-surfs what seem ten minute be just two most glaring example what make film real test viewer 's endurance . but what really anger be few scene which feature just Elvira and her ex-wife and/or her daughter . be only moment that display real human emotion , and prove core horrible film , there be excellent film struggle free . what waste .

Two : horrible , overly sentimental script that could have be use Harold Lloyd movie its so cliched . Three : choice black actor toy ; racial subtext be unbearable , its never address . there be message here , Pryor 's part could have be play comedic actor .

movie be extremely depressing.The character be so cold . mother , who be main character , be everything but " motherly " . OK , be unhappy her marriage and always put her husband and child first . her husband die . then go visit her son and meet hunk who be sleep her daughter and end up sleep . part , movie be right . notexcellent , but can be watch . guy be charming and who can blame ? OK be notvery motherly sleep your daughter 's lover but let 's blame shock lose her husband.She become totally obsessed guy . think be part where start dislike movie . be always there want please " old fashion way " snack be work her son 's house ( guess be only thing ever learn do ) , as be only way could get his attention . guy obviously be notvery interested ( actually , seem more consider sleep charitable activity ) and instead be insult , continue beg go go bed and be nice when become very abusive .

( nor can see other character learn or grow either , matter . ) want kick and tell get bloody life first episode , and feeling do n't change last one . Shinji truly possess kind helpless hopelessness that make people angry rather charitable , and Asuka be such infuriate know-it-all want smash TV screen time come view . oh , and more anyone else , two hate everything , and say veeeeeeeery often.I be otherwise big fan anim and manga , and never before have dislike so much . read series creator/writer write while suffering depression , and can believe ; make depress watch . be aim series ? be honestly ask . be design make viewer confuse and annoy ? and suffer depression , why just notwrite book or biography , instead mix up alien and mecha 's ? alien war plot , as far could tell , lead absolutely nowhere.Finally , be truly fascinate how many people claim love patchwork dead-end plot , ca n't help but wonder how many actually find good , and how many say do have be tell be .

could have Been marvelous story base Ancient Races Cat people , but wasn't.This work could have be just that ; marvelous and replete mythological reference which keep my fascination fuel . lead character ( Charles Brady play Brian Krause ; and his mother Mary , play Alice Krige ) be shallowly do , have depth personality and be hardly likable or drawing . noteven Mdchen Amick ( who play Tanya Robertson) 's character fit description.However , have say many time before , when adapt Stephen King novel TV , simply must take account fact his book be n't write TV , and his screenplay talent sadly lack fire and depth exhibit novelist.This be botched attempt take magick Stephen King writing , that be his novel or original screenplay . simply cut and paste his work small screen . his novel get completely bastardize process and all end up create be nice movie ; nothing less but certainly nothing more . his screenplay be hit and miss . unfortunately , screenplay translation be miss.Sorry , sorry , sorry movie.This movie get 1.negative ... fiend : .

 Granting budget and time constraint serial production , Batman and Robin nonetheless earn place bottom " cliffhanger " list , utterly lack style , imagination , and atmosphere its 1943 predecessor , BATMAN.The producer , Sam Katzman , be know " King Quickies " and , his director , Spencer Bennett , seem more concern speed and efficiency generating excitement . ( unfortunately , team also produce two Superman serial , star Kirk Alyn , their tacky fly animation , canned music , and dull support player . ) opening chapter offer taste thing come : thoroughly inane title ( " Robin Rescues Batman , " " Batman vs Wizard " ) , mechanical music drone , and our two hero stumble camera look all around , either confuse or have trouble see their cheap Halloween mask . Batman 's cowl , its devil 's horn and eagle 's beak , fit so poorly stuntman have adjust fight scene . his " utility belt " be crumpled strip cloth compartment , which still manage pull blowtorch and oxygen tube critical moment ! case , lead player be miscast . Robert Lowery display little charm or individual flair Bruce Wayne , and do notcut particularly dynamic figure Batman . create impression will rather be somewhere , anywhere else ! John Duncan , Robin , have considerable difficulty handle his limited dialogue . be too old part , even old stuntman filling . out costume , Lowery and Duncan be as exciting tired businessman amble out drink , one ounce chemistry evident Lewis Wilson and Douglas Croft 1943 serial.Although serial be notknow character development , early Batman manage present more energetic cast . one offer group go motion , notfilmmaker provide much support . notone hoodlum stand out , and be lead one most boring villain ever , " Wizard . " ( great name ! ) actually , be lead someone sport curtain , shawl , and sack his head , dub voice that desperately try sound menace . " prime suspect " -- eccentric professor , radio broadcaster -- be simply annoying.Even established comic book " regular " be superfluous . be hard discern much romance Vicki Vale and Bruce Wayne . peril face , Vicki display virtually emotion . Commissioner Gordon be none-too-bright . previous serial , Alfred butler be mere walk-on whose most important line be " Mr Wayne 's residence . " be prop drawn-out , gimmick-laden , incoherent plot , further saddle uninspired , repetitive music and amateurish production design . Wayne Manor exterior resemble suburban middle-class home sitcom , interior cheap roadside motel . Batcave be office desperately need refurbishing . ( costume be keep roll up filing cabinet ! )Pity filmmaker could n't invest more effort create thrilling adventure . availability two serial DVD be plus serious " Batfan , " should notbe fool excellent illustration box . capture more authentic mood comic book 15 chapter Batman and Robin combined.Now good news -- be not1997 version !
( Spoiler include , would say)This film be notpossible take seriously . part be so awfully stupid just ca n't help laugh all . try sequence where Stallone 's character jump 20 meter full climb gear or ( and be really my favorite ) snuff bad guy stick stalactite . yeah , what ungodly strength do muster accomplish such feat ? I dunno , but sure give reality run money .
self-indulgent mess may have put kibosh Mr. Branagh 's career adapter Shakespeare cinema . ( release 4 year ago ; notpeep adaptation since . ) just finish watch cable -- holy God , 's terrible.I agree sentiment reviewer who say review something so obviously and sadly awful be ungenerous act that come as shrill . be say , will take risk , only *Love be Labour 's Lost* be perfect reward who overrate Mr. Branagh 's directorial ability past . Branagh have always be pretty lousy director : grindingly literal-minded ; star-struck ; unforgivably ungenerous his fellow actor ( love his American star , but love more , make damn sure get all good lines).Along line , sad fact remain *Love be Labour 's Lost* be scarcely bad interminable , ghastly , bloated *Hamlet* 1996 . fact , film may be preferable , only be about 1/3 length . Branagh decide would be good idea update bad early work Shakespeare have milieu Cole Porter , George Gershwin , Fred Astaire , yada yada . so set thing 1939 , leave eighth text intact favor egregious interpretation thirty ' standard ( wait see actor heave up wire ceiling " be Heaven " ) , and cast actor notknow their dancing or singing ( include ) . result be disaster so surreal be left dumbfounded just do n't call horrify stop whole thing look first daily . do n't even blame cast . paraphrase Hamlet , " screenplay be thing ! " one could possibly come off well hodge-podge : illustrious RSC alumnus fare no good Alicia Silverstone . who could possibly act thing ? Branagh 's first mistake be think *Love 's Labour 's Lost* be play worth film . trust , be n't . be anomaly Bard 's canon , write expressly educate coterie courtier -- notusual audience which write . hence , there be lot precious ( and TEDIOUS ! ) word-play , reference contemporary scholastic nonsense , parody Lyly 's *Euphues* . . . other word , hardly sort material appeal broad audience . hell , do n't appeal audience already predispose Shakespearean comedy . play can be stage drastically cut text and desperately " update " gimmick that come hand . which beg question , why bother ? Branagh 's second mistake be think Shakespeare 's cream-pie play could be serve side-order Gershwin 's marmalade . clearly idea , or hope , be make unintelligible Elizabethan exercise palatable modern audience administer nostalgic American pop culture their throat same time . but again , beg question , why bother ?
This be one most boring movie have ever see do n't really know why just your run-of-the-mill story guy who be about get married , and start fancy someone else instead . story have be tell thousand time . nothing new or innovative all.I do n't really know what be wrong film . most time when kind actors/actresses get together make film that have already be make million time before , be really entertaining . there be usually little clever thing that be n't really other . reason , one just do n't hold your attention . can pick out funny part , or clever idea , but reason be just notfunny , nor clever way wish new how explain , but do n't just do n't waste your time one
ca n't believe so much talent can be waste one movie ! Gingerbread Man start right foot , and manage build up great expectation ending . but point movie turn one bad story have ever waste my time on . be just so unbelievably how bewitch Mallory Doss manage pull Kenneth Branagh 's character around his nose . movie climax be as uninteresting and flat beer , which have be leave out sun too long . Gingerbread Man be probably bad Grisham-movie ever and be n't change fact talented star crowd movie . do n't waste your time here !
thing call " House Dead " bad movie time be be really not. there be bad movie there . watch alot Hong Kong Ninja movie that be basically result unfinished Japanese police drama have footage ninjas insert end create something that could technically be call " movie."House Dead be however one bad film have ever see theatre . walk out way through , actually feel be somewhat dumb have set 45 minute piece garbage .
, first 10 minute film , do n't realize main character , who write life advice column , be go have tables-oh-so-cleverly-turned and learn valuable life lesson , then there be probably something wrong . set up be so predictable as ruin movie , even rest movie be good ( which isn't)There be almost chemistry lead , and Steve Carell 's stalker-ish behavior be embarrassing , notfunny . be hard believe Binoche 's character would have interest . then end be all wrap up so wonderful and everyone life happily ever . be n't great America !
once get amazed how Bad film can be , and how world anybody could raise money make kind crap . there be absolutely talent include film - crappy script , crappy story crappy acting . Amazing ...
be still try decide be indeed , bad film have ever see - very disturbing problem film be real scientist be interview , but their footage be edit make look as support idea many BSers who populate film . BS signal ratio interview be about ten thousand one - end , interviewee seem be say , " want _think_ ! ! " , but be too lazy do simple research thing assert fact.If feel be open-minded , and wish expand your consciousness , please be open-minded enough read actual book quantum theory : " Einstein 's Universe " , Nigel Calder ( slim volume , notchallenge ) , " Cosmic Code " , Heinz Pagels . ca n't bring read book , please do n't complain reviewer be " open-minded".To recap , film be just unbelievably bad.You know what be really good film which question nature reality ? " thirteenth floor " , direct Roland Emmerich , Craig Bierko , Gretchen Mol , Vincent D'onofrio . smart , sexy , thought-provoking .

@card@ star , and be be generous . ( minor spoiler ) Look , be low budget zombie movie set gangland Oakland . plot go , scientist want bring his dead brother back life be kill drive-by.The main problem movie : what zombie ? ! all " zombie " do be growl ( which do n't sound even remotely scary ) and drip fake red blood their mouth ! scary eye , decay flesh , just bunch people growl pathetically and run around idiots.The cover be also mislead . there be only about 6 zombie whole film , so be notwhole " hood " be plague zombie or anything , be just few , and be contain time.The act actually be so bad be hilarious . one can act movie ( maybe one gang member ) and really seem bunch friend get together , decide cast their family , and make movie one weekend.Final note : when do Doctors wear tracksuit ? ! skip one , please !

This rework Anthony Shaffer 's classic play do notlast long cinema . have recently suffer cable , still congratulate notwaste money ticket . Director Kenneth Branagh , writer Harold Pinter , and star/producer Jude Law delude their prestige alone could sustain travesty interminable 93 minute , fun or class long original.Michael Caine enhance his reputation play second lead marvelous 1972 film . now seem intent destroy attempt lead , play version Laurence Olivier . ( be nominate Best Actor Oscar , but lose Marlon Brando GODFATHER . ) look puffy and washed-out , Caine glide part less depth display Batman 's butler . have already lower guest appearance atrocious remake GET Carter . what be next -- Alfie II , or Son man who WOULD Be King ? but then , no one benefit inane adaptation Pinter , who think frequent curse and added sexual angle can compensate absence Shaffer 's witty character interplay . Branagh 's direction rely bluish lighting and soulless set design that would n't hold up second-rate nightclub . neither shadow nor tight , overact close-up can help Law overcome his dull screen persona . result be failure both straight drama and detective thriller , almost make forget purpose title.Fans original stage production ( Anthony Quayle and Keith Baxter ) and Olivier/Caine film would do well regard enterprise bad dream . late Mr Shaffer , who write 1972 screenplay , as well Hitchcock 's Frenzy and several Agatha Christie adaptation , must be turn his grave , wish could plan real murder or two !
be so disgust film , feel obligate warn off other . film have story , plot or hint purpose . film start standard " let be scary " movie intro , which now film watcher have become accustomed . so can ignore beginning completely . be soon introduce main actress and point become clear have just waste your hard earn and would be good off watch static . ( have see white noise - EEK ) Acting be DISGRACE and should return travel pantomime where come . have say , even good actor world would struggle make film remotely watch able . their poor performance merely contribute disaster . senseless violence and what can only assume be written word yet junk up " eccentric " writer , who probably consider be artist , have result film which will test your patience . be notmy fellow watcher turn and say , " have be watch 45 min " do realise film be as thin and tasteless cup tea tea bag . clearly something be miss and unfortunately be n't audience . rather suggest what film be miss , let tell what have : dumb Blonde ( surprise surprise ) , Victims , bad-monster-guy-thing , about 2 min storyline which be stretch hour , day , week , month ... and credits.Want silver lining ? well , blonde girl be bit saucy look scene , but expect want see her face rip off rest film !
Rosie waste lot TV time talk Tainos be super influential dynamics modern day Puerto Rican . be not. truth be African and Spanish be and know . what kill be be stand screen look average light skin black chick ( obvious black daddy , cousin and auntie)pretending truly acknowledge real essence what make modern day Puerto Ricans,but barely mention how African influence way their Spanish be speak , food and music . be so typical and lose lot respect her and will notsupport anything else do . also , want dance around her African-ness then need nottake more role associate blackness ( i.e. Lackawanna Blues ) . can find prideful Black Latina next time ( thank Zoe Saldana,Gina Torres , Gina Ravera and Melissa DeSousa).To Puerto Rican here that say be African and not" black " ... .thank .

Trust me none black want claim your " culture " either .
 Run away movie . even B-movie standard movie be dreadful . be also insidious 's theme . main theme be people who reject society and have respect anything be cool and worth admire . people who treat other respect be loser . Guncrazy be movie that speak disenfranchise lot well movie , see instead.No normal kid would do what Trent do . state trooper do notwork do film etc. see movie make realize why writer use hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold cliche . Mija be completely unsympathetic hooker,who yes , have have terrible life . however , be such terrible person audience can identify her.Usually there be one thing movie can be recommend , case there be none . be such ridiculous movie insult person who try identify main character . acting be adequate B-movie standard and direction present nothing new or interesting .
there be really two section film . firstly there be laughable prologue film which be so hysterical and cornball would almost feel appropriate ' Simpsons ' Troy McClure should be do narration.Then rest film begin ( start off title song which really do n't fit rest film ) which , technically OK , be kill vague , inconsistent and unconvincing plot and notjust uninteresting character , but character that make sense.This be especially so Mickey Rooney 's Spiventa , who be supposedly plot and part ' organisation ' whole time yet what would have happen have Hackman make seemingly arbitrary decision take when break out ? case would have be totally superfluous and unnecessary character , which end still is.The overall problem film be be totally unwilling put detail who or what be conspiracy . be as filmmaker do n't have courage imply particular section society would be capable create such organisation and instead settle hope lack explanation would suffice and audience would form their own conclusions.Put simply , film fail level .
do n't know anything film or be base good selling book.Tried guess opening scene what would be about,best guess,buried treasure and death list.That last about 15 minute when i get sneaky suspicion film be crap.I will notbore how bad plot and acting be but anyone who give more two star must work film makers.I watch hero jump his corvette rush hospital.He have his his suit,shirt and tie arrive hospital jean and t/shirt.Could n't even get continuity right . get Christian theme,hard miss .

Michael Des Barres present all depth rain puddle . really seem get thrust and profanity sex part , but when come actually acting Arquette and Kinski , be adrift . Rosanna Arquette be close thing actor film , give bearable performance and look genuinely hurt when finally discover her perfect husband be lecherous animal . Nastassja Kinski be far too compassionate therapist , but least have act happening here . rest cast be just collection elevated body double whom give think provoke line ` hit hard , be good can do ?

may nothave long attention-spans , but be second movie have refuse see all way , and even buy DVD its " classic " status.At first , think director be play big joke , so keep wait resolution , something laugh , something keep my interest , but resolution never come . rather , writing be laughably amateurish , movie drag and feel disjointed , like someone cut TV series feature-length . Academy must have be drug when nominate movie less eight Oscars.Once again , repeat . be second movie have refuse watch all way through . first be " exterminator " . hope give indication how bad really be . negative
John Huston 's Wise Blood be more horrify misrepresentation Flannery O'Connor 's book could have imagine . utterly terrible acting performance ( and do n't , " oh that be do purpose , just do n't get " me ! ) musical score that be more suit episode Rockford Files , film be revolting . view ill-will outset , and , fact , expect pleasant experience . but misrepresentation southern character , ridiculously fraudulent southern drawl lilt , comedic way their faith be portray , be inexcusable . right down 's end , which be completely devoid character sentiment , fail place O'Connor 's book shine and resonate . actor portray " southern " policeman may as well have be eat smother hot-dog NYC street stand and quote Godfather . one redeeming acting performance be Ned Beatty 's lively and dead-on representation Hoover Shoates , religious con-artist who hear Moates preach Church Christ Christ and see dollar sign and business opportunity . O'Connor 's powerful book be most well-known be creepy , religious undercurrent that jibe seemingly lifeless cadaver " Faith " . Mr. Huston 's film be shameful mockery author 's intention , be understand and most her fan , may be so bold as say so . acknowledge ca n't know exactly what author wish convey , have enough affection her and her work desire remain fan . view Wise Blood way Mr. Huston apparently do , would have throw trash . Flannery 's sake , and mine , forgive , John Huston . forget ... .that will take time .
movie do n't even deserve one . be utter waste time . be waste film and money . be notoffensive but everything be provocative and disgusting . my spoiler be one think should be read everyone . there be full frontal nudity and disgusting language . but notonly that , there be No plot line , actor be terrible , accent be horrible , actor be small time and be even excited watch movie ! only reason rent be Brian van Holt ( who get only fifteen second part , way ) . think might have be mistake director and editor part but repeat same segment two or three time , add only new sentence.A film similar be Eraser Head , possibly most disturbing movie existence . there be plot line , and be notfunny . be n't try be funny . do notWATCH Either Movie .
movie start out scroll text which take nearly five minute . give basic summary what be go on . could have easily be do act but instead get scroll text effect . soon be bombard character learn little about , keep in mind be ALL will learn . plot start get off ground and then crash entire movie . notonly do plot change , but might even ask your watch same movie . have never play video game , but know people who have . my understanding have play game or notmovie do notget well . save your money like sleep theater .
series would have be lot well have just do one simple thing : make Ian McShane Code Name : Diamond Head instead Code Name : tree . Diamond Head character need someone who could handle role lovable rogue , which McShane prove could do Lovejoy series . Roy Thinnes , actual Diamond Head , be really only so-so role . McShane be notreally good bad guy Tree . France Nuyen 's character , Tso-Tsing , ca n't seem make up her mind be hapless victim or tough-and-ready-to-fight woman . really earn her pay end when have play role Diamond Head 's lover . view episode or two , end up notcare what happen anyone . tree give lot hate , but Diamond Head give nothing like . unfortunately , spy genre 1970s be notquite be 1960 's .
have see thousand movie and have never write review , but Red Eye witness be so odd glowing tribute post here be compel offer my two cent protest- and vote low score possible just bring average closer reality.This be dull , boring stinker film that be memorable only its apologist depiction terrorist ' target ( John Bolton-esquire bully diplomat who be really great guy , do n't know ) and oh-so-handsome and popular Dr. Phil ( whose bestsel book , learn , be read frequent flier worldwide ) . only real Red Eye experience be rub my eye disbelief.Before fork out $10 or so dollar B movie , read select ' Quotes ( trailer ) ' , and ask will really enjoy movie which be clever line be find . unfortunately , nothing else film be any good . basic premise be goofy hell ; acting be bland and uninspired , completely lack pro/antagonist chemistry ; potential suspense be thwart turn- last five minutes- poor directing and anticipatory edit ; script be riddle incongruity like : early reveal heroine university lacrosse star be call question when later battle antagonist field hockey stick ; and plot hole be wide First Class ( character development be strictly Coach).And then there be moment extreme ridiculousness , when daughter high level public servant do nothead straight airport security , her first opportunity , warn assassination plot both head Homeland Security and her father . or when same woman run hell-bent-for-leather slick airport linoleum , arm pistoning and vein her neck bulge , wear 4 inch stiletto heel . or when her pursuer chase likewise sucking wound his trachea . or when terrorist use fishing pole bring up their weapon freak harbor bottom . be always willing suspend disbelief , but be notgo leap 30,00 foot parachute.The one good thing can say movie be portray woman who be capable ( even bimbo form ) handle most extreme emergencies- kind gender imaging sorely lack American movie . other , movie never really take off , and be no more thrilling red eye flight Boston NY . remember last time get sucker deceptive trailer and glowing tributes- forum or elsewhere ? be one time . wait Red Eye video , and do n't watch then , either .
pick movie cover alone think i be adventure level " Indiana Jones and Temple Doom " . unfortunately be virtual yawn . notyawn i have have before though . yawn be so large i could barely find anything quality movie . cover describe amazing special effect . there be none . movie be so lightweight even stereotype be awfully portray . do give idea can solve problem violence . good want teach your kid that . do n't . keep away one . be look family entertainment then might find something that be more inspiring elsewhere .
glory day 90s ( god rest its soul ) could turn great Comedy Central hour day and see great sketch comedy show time Saturday Night Live . Whpat glorious show that be , be original Not-Ready-for-Primetime player or second golden age SNL feature greats- Chris Farley , Adam Sandler , David Spade ... and then , all go hell . be first expose MadTV year and half ago , and think must have pass out shock . how could show so terrible prevail so long ? there be so many horrible flaw . suppose will start writing . writing , most part , be terrible . be nothing more kindergarten bathroom humor . cast , most part , be talentless . there be few sketch have enjoy , such Ms. Swan and Stuart , and there be few talent show such magnificent Alex Borstein . Phil LaMarr be talented actor , just notcomedian . there few sparse ha ha moment , be notenough redeem endless line horrible drivel populate babble idiot . miss one .
do regret have buy series . expect more action , more objective picture and more consistency . be just pure propaganda series , very dark , charm , or romanticism , be just boredom . find actor work quite weak well . O'Donnell might seem charming Robin ( Batman ) , but picture lack charm . probably become old , be loose his childish charm but do notgain charm grow up . come surprise , be notshow lot country and be be sell UK 40 % recommended price and be noteven release Netherlands .
thing be horrible . Ben Affleck character be self-center and gleefully sadistic--punch-you-in-the-nose fratboy sadistic . and be romantic HERO ! his cartoonish character do notchange begin end , but his money ultimately allow buy happiness.If be socialist , would screed belief , but be notSocialist.We capitalist little Christmas magic time time . ai n't magic . do n't know what be . be just awful . and be horrible waste talent . O'Hara have be make laugh hysterically late ' 70s . Gandolfini . Applegate . people be all underuse . Ben be out equation , folk might have dream up something excellent .
be bad 80s TV show get loose and try become soft-core porn movie . oh my god be bad . plot character have little relevance . plot be n't anything speak . something stalker , guess . end shoot ? be notreally clear , but somehow there be volleyball game involve . and main character ( Randy ) sleep lot . only reason my friend rent movie be Casper Van Dien be , and end up want fast forward scene , which be barely watchable . thank god do n't spend money , but want hour my life back .
previous comment make write . say Muslim be blonde and Serbs be dark ( our blood be mixed ) . comment just say opinion can be make racist.Look,race be nothing.I be color blind.I look Pierce Brosnan but be no Irish . so what ? might add be not100 % Serb,that have Austrian and Croat blood but whats point.I be dark , half-breed ? be so ? anyone use racial prejudice such bad intent Lantos(producer9and director be racist me.Karadzhic , Izetbegovich , Milosevic , Tudjman be monster and blame destroy my life , my family , my country , Yuggoslavia . hope will be all hell but wont return our dead relative back . be proud be Serb and be proud my cousin , Austrians,Croats,Muslims , Hungarian , Arabs ( yes be Serbia and have multiethnical family).This movie do n't show suffering Serbs or Croat Sarayevo,terrible terrorism street gangs,Muslim extremism.I add : kneel and pray innocent sister and brother Muslim,catholic or orthodox , kill war.This film be manipulation our misery,false humanitarianism be which do n't help all.It help Lantos fill his pocket more doe,alright !
think be never go find horror movie bad " return Texas Chainsaw Massacre " , but film compete it.Im notperson that get asleep when watch movie , but do 15 minute trance start . wake up , and start watch agian . why do deserve that ? all movie be torture , have use fast forward watch complete.I cant stand why one my favourite actor time ( Mr . Walken ) could do thing . have think make director favor , or be really need money , film film be do , be ruin ; and so fast ... what movie ? its notscary , stupid plot , character be awful ( but really like one play Jared Harris ) , effect be very poor , lack death & blood , etc ; three word , have anything . and mean . cant stand how director can make film this.Anyway , when get more disappoint be when see video cover , film be present " Stephen King " , think could never present crap , no ? ( rent Argentina ) . notrecommend million years.I rate movie 2 out 10 . ( say my " return Texas Chainsaw Massacre " review , there will be always bad movie , thats why dont deserve 1 out 10 )
first one be different and funny . attempt should have never leave studio . movie do notmake laugh . be weak attempt gross humor . movie pick out current and old movie rip-off . time joke seem use and overdo . audience see only re-act Hannibal dinner scene and be otherwise asleep .
Robert Forster , normally very strong character actor , be lose sea here cast New York family man seek revenge thug who murder his son and attack his wife home invasion . scary subject matter exploit cheapjack thrill " Death Wish " vein . be n't difficult scoff smarmy proceeding : dialogue be full howler , crime statistic be irrevocably date , and support character be ridiculously over-written ( particularly despicable judge who allow accuse murderer walk right out courtroom ) . low-rent production be contemptible its self-righteousness , especially violence our city have only increase . * ****
Stephen J. Cannell apparently decide few year ago would broaden his horizon and dabble horror . result , " Dead Above Ground " , be abysmal piece junk . now , have notice his name association This particular film will have put back but no , do n't have my glass and therefore miss , damn , really do need bring video shopping . first question would be , who heck be target audience ? be almost " scary " kid movie , but then again there be topless babe and gore and bad word spout here and there . main character be so cute want see someone , anyone , go farm implement SOME kind . seem guy open bed and breakfast that have checker past , child-murdering witch that collect child 's tooth live there . probably something real estate agent fail mention . course now modern day there be little girl ghost around warn real-live little girl that now live there something bad be go happen . do , and there be also two Bubbas that be squat property when new owner take over be out revenge too . whole thing have feel made-for-cable junk that be kid Halloween , course , thing that be n't suitable little kid , so notonly be mediocre , be confused , too . big boo and hiss Anchor Bay put out too , consider their usual track record fine release be new low . UK get Phantasm Box Set , get " Tooth Fairy " . hardly seem fair . 1 out 10 , absolute garbage .
OK , kinda like idea movie . be age demographic , and kinda identify story . even sometimes tacky and meaningless dialogue seem semi-realistic , and different movie would have be forgivable.I be try as hard as possible nottrash movie other do , but be noteasy when filmmaker be n't try all.The edit movie be terrible ! possibly bad edit have ever see movie ! there be thing do n't have go film school learn , lean good edit be notone , but identify bad one is.Also , shot ... oh my God shot , just awful ! ca n't even go detail , but sometimes just see random thing pop up , and , conjunction edit will give most painful film view experience.This movie be make low or budget 4 cast and crew be notexcuse also . have see short film youtube lot more artistic integrity ! Joe , Greta , do n't know what heck be think , but movie be nothing but masturbation both your ego . should be ashamed ! conclusion , movie be what really lazy amateur porn movie will be be fill 3 or 4 lousy sex scene separate long boring conversation and one disgusting masturbation scene . be notyour kind thing , avoid cost !
could name plenty funny movie . there be comedy that set out be funny , and be . movie , Gymkata example , try be serious but end up funny . Ladies Man be film that be desperately try be funny , but could notbe less funny be about guy who get lot chick middle wreckage nuclear holocaust . be anti-funny.I do n't think laugh hard chuckle anything movie . be simply unfunny . be boring , stupid , inane , annoy , mind-bogglingly bad , but notfunny . do n't particularly care Tim Meadows , or character SNL , but expect good this.The movie be completely lack logic or common sense . be script writer have bag his head be type and could n't see which key be hit . tell " origin " Ladies Man , but fail include motivation his bizarre fascination act be still seventy . movie try get humor out man who appear pleasure porn , shortly try hang . be comedy ? like consider have pretty keen sense humor ( spend lot time write comedy do ) , but maybe be just notquite bright enough film.Lee Evans , so funny Tucker there be something Mary , be outrageously bad here . be plead my head shut up.By end be pound my chair , mutter my breath , and have film go long , would probably have attempted suicide . film might notbe as bad Battlefield Earth , but be first movie have see that be come close .
Mix exotic tropical location , babe skimpy attire , explosion , good-looking Dudley Do-Right clone , movie star his good year ( Martin Sheen ) , little martial art and sexy villainess ( Tracy Lor ... ..er , sorry ... Tracy Elizabeth Lords ) and will think will be escapist fun . not! be dreary TV movie and even like promote " Charlie 's Angels " deal,it be nowhere near good original series or even gawdawful , irretrievably stupid , recent C.A. movie . abomination be well describe Third RATE Andy Sidaris film . nowhere much fun Andy 's " Hard Ticket Hawaii " , fight scene be decent enough . girl spend too much time pose and try too look prissy and get annoy while . there be good genre stuff out there . oh yeah , and " babe " be n't as hot like think be . terrible soundtrack ... when be there .
movie be just plain terrible . Poor John Savage have stoop low order be movie . star rare type vampire that be help lady that look wash out and throw street hooker that be dancer local strip club . acidently taste drop blood dancer who happen be one rare vampire get carry away make out floor dress room . Savage be then assign short leader rare vampire breed that look cross 80 's punk rock and one Olsen twin purple hair . movie just get all crazy Savage rap and dance midget tattoo spider his head , also one rare . quote Elephant Man and Jimmy Durante and just have laugh . just get rediculas . and then most gross special effect could come up be Corri throw up her organ and pull out her mouth . and can tell be all fake . her son do n't know what do his mom new identity and become more pest object serenity . enjoy good vampire film , believe do but just hate one . even photography stink , and blur camera switch way and try make look vampire move fast camera keep up and then camera turn all bright scene Savage chase son Corri blind . avoid one ! !
This be bad movie have ever see . Avengers hold dubious honor but no longer . acting " Jill Ripper " be terrible and be only eclipse plot . movie be as intellectually stimulating Telletubbes . do n't know want be S&M ; flick or really bad thriller . only watch extreme intoxication or be bed ridden and need leather clad distraction . script should be rework porn , would n't take very much effort and would have long shelf life . porn , even bad porn , would n't do damage Dolf Lundgren 's career way movie have .
My one line summary should explain , but will have go it.From get-go , movie seem overdo soap opera , and be about all can comment on . there be few interesting scene , such " big one " that hit middle movie , but , wait , what be that ? earthquake *gasp* , wait minute ! be Dante 's Peak ! well , part butcher and slap in . ca n't believe how poorly movie be do , " borrowing " scene other , much good film . wonder what director think viewer be dumb enough believe large wooded mountain-esque backdrop exist downtown LA , ala Dante 's Peak.My advise , forget Bond Wanna-be , Nash , film and go real thing ( again , someone Dante 's Peak coincidentally . )
 Wow ! remember so many awful film that loosely revolve high school early 1980s . usually have someincredibly strain plot and lot 27 year old actor pretend be student . watch film feel little nostalgia grow up 1980s . however , then find out film be make 1989 ? say what ! well , nostalgia factor end right there , be just bad . plot have city prepare close high school and threaten bus student inner city high school . which be odd , that student school be wealthy and abundant . fact , main character life mansion . make wonder how can find money keep school alive , have never hear property tax . oh , but here be kicker . school board say will keep school alive , student can raise $200,000 . senior go do . hmmm , raise $200,000 but instead save college , put save high school be Senior ? and why exactly would close overpopulated school year be out ? and ... ahh forget , film be stupid and make 1989 ! ?
movie be so badly write , direct and act beggar belief . should be remake good script , director and casting service . bad problem be acting . have Jennifer Beals one hand who be polished , professional and totally believable , and other hand , Ri'chard , who be woefully miscast and just jarring particular piece . Peter Gallagher and Jenny Levine be just awful slave own ( and keep ) couple , normally do fine work . actor ( and director ) should nothave attempt do accent all--they be inconsistent and unbelievable . much well have concentrate do good job actual English . casting be ludicrous . why have child " African " merchant ( thus less socially desirable gens de couleur society ) be cast very pale skinned actor , supposedly socially desirable Marcel , have pronounce African feature , include obviously dye blond " fro " ? be as casting director can be bother read script be cast and choose appropriate actor large pool extremely talented and physically diverse actor color . be just so weird ! could be great movie and should be re-made , but people who respect material and can choose appropriate and skilled actor . there be plenty good actor there , and would be fun see how Jennifer Beals , Daniel Sunjata and Gloria Reuben would do appropriate cast , good script and decent direction .

Cedric Kahn 's film have be character-based , rather action-based ( be think L'Ennui and Feux rouge ) be jar see series really expert car chase intersperse plod attempt give character Succo . do n't find Stefano Cassetti be interesting actor ; remind pro athlete who be coax movie , Bret Favre . blank stare look really vicious deer catch headlight . real actor would have force reflect more Succo 's personality , rather admire his skill carjacking.The little acting there be come mainly Isild le Besco needy schoolgirl Succo take storm . interview police office be marvel bland obstinacy little fear future blend . Le Besco apart , there be little recommend film .
Cut chase , be one five bad film have ever seen.Not do n't try . there be decent writing element structure there , good cast , good acting . be notsure where go wrong , but go horribly wrong.Some element may have be bad structure and substantive story , lot overact lead ( who probably be much good when restrained ) , bad directing and edit . have enough hour , tear my hair out hour and half and very agitate hour and fifty minute run . there be also insincerity all , being go someone who use be heroin addict . be agitate glamorize something that have nothing good . be bolster pretty 17 year-old girl who be love 30 year-old junkie.And frantic nature lead be turn-off enough . there be clunky plot point that be attempt structure , but end result be listless and unending ( uneven time line ) . character be colorful but end , which make feel bad quality actor who have just notsee enough.Skip . assume be first-time director who be enamor his own turd , but have do . be puzzle how and many other really bad idea find someone who will actually give money .

One Stinko movie feature shopworn plot and , be kind , act less Oscar caliber . but single bad flaw be total misrepresentation jet aircraft , and especially 747 . major blunders:1 . Flight Engineer ( or even flight engineer station . 2 . Mis-identifying F-16 interceptor F-15 's ( resmblance whatsoever ) . 3 . load passenger " aft baggage compartment " supposedly accesible cabin - even such compartment exist , place much weight far aft would make aircraft unflyable . 4 . hollow point bullet " wo n't damage aircraft " . 5 . entire landing procedure be so bad want puke . 6 . SR-71 ( plane ) pressure seal hatch 7 . open cabin door outward - wind - flight ! !Ah nut , be just truly lousy movie . Gotta make list bottom 10 year .
@card@ star out possible 10 - and that be be overly generous.I think cast James Woods , Cathy Bates , Randy Quaid , Lou Gossett , Jr. , and Henry Thomas - how could miss . be wrong.I can only wonder what drug Sam Shepard be week-end crank out piece dribble . have long suspect Sam S. be kind nut , film , base his play , confirm it.This be kind artsy b.s. that actor Love sink their tooth give chance endlessly emote . however , viewer who sit nonsensical trash , there be absolutely NOTHING love movie.You have n't see dysfunctional family have see bunch . Pa be crazy , Ma be crazy , son be crazy and daughter be , oh yeah , crazy . also have mouth utter word that would make sailor blush , especially teenage daughter.In addition above , as be n't enough , plot--and be so thin could read thorough it--has hole size Alaska.Ma be conspire sell their rundown farm . turn out so be Pa. now do n't claim be real estate expert , but last time check , property jointly own must have owner signature order be sell . only one own property , then other could notlegally sell , so would be pointless person do so . Mr. Shepherd prefer ignore basic fact , and therefore , his plot do notwork.Not anything else be really work anyway.The only possible reason anyone could have watch film be be absolutely desperate see James Woods full frontal nudity , and ca n't imagine why anyone would want .
movie be big waste nine dollar have spend very , very long time . know how often go movie will probably say , that be hard imagine , but never-the-less , be true ! see trailer movie , know have see ! be fan horror , mystery , and suspense , why would n't ? trailer be nothing less intriguing and exciting ; unfortunately , movie be none these.From cinematography , script , acting , movie be complete flop . be read , plan go movie expect thrill , mystery , action , horror , or anything other waste hour and forty-five minute be afraid be disappointment."Why be so bad , " might be ask . let tell . movie be neither mysterious nor suspenseful . nothing movie make least bit " edge , " frighten , or curious . script be good laughable . there be numerous time film where dialogue be just so ridiculous begin write off comic relief only find out few second later be n't . act be absolutely dreadful . like Nicholas Cage but be miss . exception , performance movie be incredibly below average . cinematography be awful notone moment suspense or mystique . finally , story be completely transparent . can see end movie come mile away.I be notusually very harsh critic . frankly , when go see comedy want laugh and when go see mystery/suspense/horror , just want be surprise . movie be boring , poorly act , poorly write , and overwhelming disappointment . do favor and go see something else .

Such long await movie. . but have disappoint and my friend who have go see movie first day. . trailer look action movie , but turn out be out & out comedy(a bad comedy ) . but one thing that deserve appreciation be acting professional actor , have do their part movie very well . good acting , but i do n't think that can save movie. . India have be shoot beautifully . Kerala , Rajasthan , ( Ladakh ? ) be all saturate color , alright . nevertheless way intrinsic beauty place be shoot make want find out exactly where place be and when could go there ; -)Action sequence be shoot very shabbily , one could make out head & tail stunt , have use Akki(akshay kumar ) very well but could have be do much much better..Animation be bad i have see recent movies(90 's movie have good animation scene i guess(initial scene where car be fall off ' flying should be good word ' road lake).And movie name have be mention nearly 20 30 min , just make sure audience do n't forget movie name i guess. .
" Intensive Care " Dorna von Rouveroy be easily one bad horror movie ever made.This extremely cheap Dutch slasher flick offer gore and plenty absurd situations.A horror veteran George Kennedy be completely waste as Professor Bruckner.The acting be abysmal,the action be slow and climax be laughable.A famous surgeon have car accident.He lie coma seven year and then wake up and go bloody rampage."Intensive Care " be clearly influence American slasher film include " Halloween " and " Friday 13th " series.The killing be hilarious and dialog be painfully stupid.Still be right mood can give piece trash look.You will laugh hurt one-you can believe !
A mediocre Sci-Fi Channel original picture . little squirmish , but notmuch . nuclear power submarine U.S.S. Jimmy Carter be mission deep thick frigid ice North Pole when be attack giant super charge electric eel . member crew ( Simmone Jade Mackinnon)thinks have devise way communicate monster , but be notgive much chance vague reason . also crew are:David Keith , Mark Sheppard and Sean Whalen . movie could have be somewhat good eels/monsters be notcartoonish .

Dane be proud handful good Danish movie that have be produce recent year . be terrible shame , however , surge quality have lead majority Danish movie critic lose their sense criticism . fact , have become so bad no longer trust review Danish movie , and result have stop watch theaters.I know be wrong hold unfortunate development one movie , so let stress " Villa Paranoia " would be terrible film circumstance . fact be hyped critic just add fuel my bonfire disillusionment Danish film . furthermore , wait come out DVD be very little help unshakable feeling have waste time and money.Erik Clausen be accomplished director knack social realism Copenhagen setting . particularly enjoy " De Frigjorte " ( 1993 ) . actor be usually funny , generally play same role his movie , namely working-class slob who be down his luck , partly be slob but mostly society , and who redeem do something good his community.This be problem number one " Villa Paranoia " ; Clausen cast chicken farmer , which be such break norm never succeed make credible.It be much bad , however , film have make twist and turn and break rule how tell story make audience understand what be go on . instance , movie open very sad attempt visualize near-death experience main character use low-budget effect and bad camera work . , character tell her good friend suddenly feel urge throw off bridge . be symptomatic whole movie ; there be little or motivation action character , and Clausen resort low form communicate whatever motivation there be : tell instead show . thus , one point , have character talk out loud purportedly catatonic person way feel , script would n't allow act out his feeling ; and later on , voice-over be abruptly introduce , quite possibly afterthought , convey feeling that would otherwise remain unknown audience due director 's ineptitude . fortunately , point be roughly hour past caring character , let alone so-called story.The acting , which have frequently be problem Clausen 's movie , can be sum up one sad statement : Sren Westerberg Bentsen , whose only other claim stardom be contestant Big Brother , be no bad several herald actor cast.I give 2-out-of-10 rating .
film be flagrant rip-off one good novel time , Silas Marner George Eliot.The detail film show IMDb do give acknowledgement original authoress but do notsee beginning film , only credit end say " suggest book Silas Marner " . suggest ? be nothing but complete rip- off all essential element story:A wrong and sad old man , artisan , poor and lonely , have all his money steal . One night child wander up his door her mother lie die snow outside . man take and bring up one day local squire ( or rich politician here ) demand adopt child . be who have father child illicit affair year before . battle then ensue who should have legal custody child.In and other aspect film , story be exactly same . only one can find difference . Silas Marner have epilepsy - but perhaps that would have strain act ability Mr Martin too far . top that have his hair dye carrot juice concoction ( presumably make look young , but actually make look more clown be ) ! there be also addition meaningless joke , offbeat comedian can resist bring story which have part and only detract profoundness story . when child cry courthouse declare can only be happy man who have father all year . be convey film girl apply nasal decongestant bridge her nose make her tearful ! be surprise legality and integrity film industry permit such film be make . be trustee George Eliot 's would insist reparation . be Steve Martin would send profit estate , or poor . very least should be entitle Silas Marner - adapt S Martin . or well still remove archives ! be interested story - and hope be - dismiss completely and watch Silas Marner . or read book ! BBC make excellent adaptation 1980 's .

Heather Graham could n't play convincing lesbian her life depend . who do producer movie think be ? ABSOLUTE WORST , most unrealistic movie i have see as long i can remember . movie be so bad i feel compel sign-up IMDb and make sure rating " film " drops.omg i be Heather Graham , i just kiss drunk chick , so be pass i be really go pace around my room HOURS ask frantically " what Have I Done ? !". . Jesus heather , get and grow up ... and i will like forward same sentiment idiot producer ... and i be , instead movie be pathetic excuse come out story , perhaps would have be more suitable focus plot character who be mentally unstable ... your so-called " lesbian " character ... , i know first time i have gay sex , when i leave next morning i jump sky excitement middle street ... honestly b*tch , get grip ... what joke ! and please note there be many many more flaw and appallingly stupid aspect lame flick , but i be so sick even think anymore . bottom line , be smart person will hate movie , and be notsmart person , then will love ... be as simple .
desperately want give movie 10 ... really do . movie , especially horror movie be so budget be good . wise-cracking ninja scarecrow who can implement corn cob lethal weaponry ... definitely fit ' budget brilliance ' system . depth movie be definitely its strong point and twist and turn implement , keep audience edge their seat really drive creepy ... ninja ... puberty-stricken ... pre-thirty year old student ... non-cowboy drawing ... wise-cracking ... son-of-a-bitch scarecrow limelight creepy horror icon year . all can really say be , ' can dig ' and recommend watch movie such Frankenfish enjoy sort hilarious horror.(WHAT HELL WERE THEY SMOKING ! ? '
This be even bad original game Death . jumble , incoherent storyline lead " Billy Lo " fall helicopter ground below , kill , be leave follow his young brother , Bobby Lo . so notonly do start out follow Bruce Lee clone , film kill one off and have follow one thirty minute story . main reason watch one be when Bobby Lo fight lion , which be quite obviously guy lion costume . Jang Lee Hwang be also villain , who be usually pretty awesome but his screen time be significantly small . mainly watch and original game death be part Bruce Lee box set . be wonder be include Lee 's finished work . one would buy otherwise .
This really be waste time ... movie have weak plot , story be fragment and end very abruptly many loophole ... .though animation be top notch.Once movie start , try give benefit doubt tell might get interesting late stage , but be never unique . same plot have be play over and over again , but what make worse be major plot hole be whole story how kill baddie ... writer could have do so much more entire concept , but seem or do nothave their heart and want close movie as soon started.Overall , too much hype but notable deliver .
sad , sad sight indeed be Munster 's Revenge . Munster be bring back one last time(Fred Gywnne receive huge paycheck come back role Herman Munster)in made-for-TV movie pair wax replica Grandpa and Herman that be robot " terrorize " city preparation robbery mummy 's stash exhibit . police their heel , two elderly television icon try find out who be actually crime order clear their name . get see dress drag waitresses(a minor highpoint film ) , grandpa turn bat attach wire couple times(one time even fly Transylvania Herman somehow invoke his frequent flyer mile guess ) , and most annoy relative " Phantom " constantly sing and break glass ad nausium ! what be most sad be hard pinpoint : be Gywnne(especially) and Al Lewis look so haggard scene and so indifferent material . be hokey costume robot that have school production value look . maybe be ridiculous script . Sid Caesar 's crazy , mostly unfunny antic . or perhaps be see something which bring joy and fond memory child be treat super K-Mart fashion makeover . even , result be decidedly disappointing and silly even Munster standard . as rest cast , Yvonne De Carlo be adequate most vacuous role(though show more cleavage usual woman her year and experience ) . K. C. Martell make ever-so-not affable Eddie Munster . Jo Mcdonell be attractive Marilyn . Bob Hastings aforementioned Phantom look and act and speak most absurd manner . film have real cheap feel even made-for-TV movie .

The Film must have be shoot day,there be scene where can see camera reflection and its red pointer,even scenery 's green light blend actor ! ! ! plot and line be really awful even slight inspiration(At least thriller genre movie).Everything that get do Poe movie,has shallow and childish approach.The film be full clise and thrilling.If want watch funny B-movie relaxing evening friend then go will enjoy ( do ) but there be way take film seriously !
This be probably one bad movie have ever see , everything be weak and incoherent . acting be absurd , costume even crummy and story be non-existent . ' poverty row ' sword and adventure film be mean capture success " Beastmaster " and " Conan " enjoy but do n't give reason follow along . lead character be tepid and dull , ca n't even fight sword and sword be 16th century . all action sequence be like , slow and unrealistic , notmention castle and horribly date music playing whenever be ride horse . do n't even bother crap .
be over 80 minute semi unexpected boredom . first , be wonder how be possible produce something . then , reach 100th minute be convince be only few more minute , and last very end which be kinda proud consider watch movie great test human 's patience and crap tolerance . be worth watching ? well , write above , want test , give try and be strong will enough , may even last end ... movie lack coherence and character seem have common sense . happening movie , can be sure see somewhere before , and seem be put movie just fill film reel .
Richard Pryor 's early 80s run down street fire incident must have affect somehow . his stand up,he joke get great laugh . seem have do something involve project choose . toy be about lame ever chose,aside guess You.A movie where white man buy his son black man ? nice little bit underlie political incorrectness be such thing . be see Richard get all sentimental make finally walk out end . want see Pryor get even brat,instead become misunderstood kid nauseum ! least Gleason have his moment . ignore and watch Pryor Gene Wilder or his ' 70s stuff . be waste movie watcher 's time !

Klaus be so much well . his performance be muted and noteworthy .
film begin narrator warn SCREAMING SKULL be so terrifying might die fright--and such happen free burial be guarantee . well , do n't think one have die fright see film , but few may have die boredom . SCREAMING SKULL be sort movie that make Ed Wood look good.Very loosely base famous Francis Marion Crawford story , SKULL be about wealthy but nervous woman who marry sinister man whose first wife die mysterious circumstance . once install his home , be torment half-wit gardener , badly execute portrait , peacock , and ultimately skull that roll room and cause scream lot . and her credit , actress Peggy Webber scream rather well.Unfortunately , her ability do so be high point film . plot be pretty transparent , say least , and cast be actually okay , script be dreadful and movie so uninspired will be ready run scream . true , thing only run sixty-eight minute , but all feel lot longer . add truly terrible print quality and there are.There be film that be so bad be fun watch . be true SCREAMING SKULL have few howlers--but film drag so much could n't work up more occasional giggle , and time whole thing be your head will roll ennui . be n't Peggy Webber 's way scream , would be surefire cure insomnia . give miss.GFT , Amazon Reviewer
" Extreme Makeover : Home Edition " be yet ' feel-goody ' , so-called ' heart warming ' , and out-for-ratings show ABC have have time put together.I understand trouble family go through . , be sorry . but would n't think put four wide-screen plasma television , three flat-screen desktop computer , inground pool take up half backyard , and closet full expensive designer clothing be bit too excessive ANY family ? sure , family have be lot . sure , deserve nice thing what have previously had.But honestly , thing Ty Pennington and his crew put house be enough suit entire neighborhood.Another thing that really irk show be how Ty and his crew always have something good say little thing that relate family , or family 's condition . tell wheelchair-bound person or be ' so strong ' , or ' very brave ' really do get old while . may sound rude , but believe ; watch show , and will see what mean.All , show be overrate . want watch , go ahead . comment be just heads-up what will be watch .
recent movement bring Asian film America , be last movie that should be release here . be big fan Asian movie genre , be browse net and come soong be re-release US market decide check out ahead time and rent local video store.Trust ... action scene be incredibly disappointing , Crouching Tiger and Iron Monkey completely blow movie out water . Jet Li would fall asleep watch fight sequence . be look martial art entertainment , your time would be good off Jackie Chan flick ! ! ! moreover ... think be go watch martial art about girl engulf vengence her parent death But Surprise ! ! ! good hour movie middle have be fill dialogue , absense action , lack devloping tangent plot , pretty much NOTHING do premise be expose . have more do relationship and boy , and boy his conspiracy group which producer/director dedicate time elbaorating , and yet dedicate portion film drag issue . would be much good off have just cut whole hour and develop story film and focus martial art aspect.Speaking which , really do n't believe choreographer Iron Monkey , do action sequence Princess Blade . be completely insult frequent usage slow motion and quick camera change portray assassin physical swiftness . just do n't buy it.Please ... be warn PLEASE do notwaste your time/money movie . premise be intrigueing , and trailer might even tempt but be positive movie be notsuit public ( maybe Japan but notstate ) and will be bad film bring over state Asian film industry .

@card@ version " Haunting " have be one my favorite horror film year , so anticipate release 1999 remake good deal trepidation . hardly seem follow-up could exceed or even equal original masterpiece . unfortunately my worry be well-founded : movie stinks.I do n't know what people involve film be think . Jan De Bont , who seem have have fluke when direct excellent " speed , " do as poorly here ( or perhaps even bad ) do much-hyped dud " Twister " and " Speed 2 : Cruise Control . " Hey Jan , stick cinematography , would ya ? Liam Neeson be adequate his role doctor-pretending-to-be-a-sleep-psychologist -- do n't think be capable turn truly bad performance -- but even can save lame script and weak story . Catherine Zeta Jones prove once again ( do " Entrapment " ) lack act ability rise material that be hand . female lead , who do great episode " X-Files , " look lose here Eleanor , insomniac hover edge sanity . and blond guy , whoever be , be more wooden laughably strange statuette child carve woodwork house . do n't think change expression once entire film.(SPOILERS AHEAD)The reason first movie work so well be be never sure house be truly haunt or manifestation be result Eleanor 's precarious mental state . spirit be actually see original , leave much up imagination--a hallmark other great horror film " Changeling " and " Blair Witch Project . " update version , course get ton CGI ghost , which basically ( face weak script/plot ) make movie totally unscary . f/x be n't even great , consider be do ILM . frozen breath look particularly fake . effect underrate Peter Jackson film " frightener , " which see just one , be lot well . wooden carving child , which be suppose look creepy , just look silly ( especially when scream ) , and CGI monster be nothing write home about . rather provide relief bad acting , bad direction , and bad writing , effect only add mess film.Some particularly dumb scene : when three other character break Eleanor 's bedroom , and none seem surprise find huge scowl demon hover bed . scene where Eleanor " see " former lady house hang rafter ... acting here be particularly bad . and last , but notleast , unintentionally hilarious bit where Wooden Blond Guy utter uninspired shout what be suppose be anguish , leap up piece furniture , and start slash away painting old , evil guy who build house . actually get satisfaction scene , second his attack , Blond Guy be drag over fireplace ghost old guy and promptly get his head cut off flue . be only part movie I enjoyed.In sum , stick original 1963 " haunting . " negative star .
smell garbage and look garbage , must be garbage . be far one bad movie have ever see my entire life .

Very disappointing version Lorna Doone . too many missing character , romantic scene , change story line , too short , appear low budget . hardly enough dialogue understand story be notfamiliar novel . scene look Lorna have cold sore her upper lip . be sure make-up do be good hide . guess do n't want halt film heal up , pity . most likely why movie lack kiss scene . only one disappointing kissing scene very end . Lorna Doone be great epic tale and should be tell true . 2000 version Lorna Doone be twice as long , more romantic , much more enjoyable and more true book .

Geoffrey Lewis look completely pathetic Frank , which be utterly stupid character . and , tell truth , be actually very surprise see Van Damme do decent job play twin . succeed achieve different tone and mood two role that be convincing . but movie be mostly very bad and sad part be be produce major motion picture studio ... which be now bankrupt .
Nick Cage be Gates , treasure hunter ( oh , excuse ... treasure " protector " , whatever mean ) who be descend long line treasure hunter . One his ancestor have be give clue whereabouts huge treasure our Founding Fathers , most notFreemason , have decide hide just do n't want finance their independence all badly.The first clue turn out be long-lost ship hide Arctic . Gates and his crew , consist financier Ian ( Sean Bean ) , Movie Dork Riley ( Justin Bartha immortal " Gigli " ) and couple faceless lackey , enter cargo hold ship . immediately spill out ton gunpowder all floor , notbe significant way . last find clue ( skeleton be hover ) and turn out be pipe writing ... . sort . do n't ask explain.It be riddle , and fact his expedition be clearly miff notfind actual treasure , Gates wander yammer meaning riddle , frozen cargo hold , crew just stand around slack-jawed . mean , come . someone should have be little vocal their disappointment come all way freak Arctic and notfind anything interesting , but just stand there Gates enter his own world , solve riddle.The next clue turn out be Declaration Independence . Ian decide steal . Gates be appall . various character deliver gratingly obvious exposition ( get use ) . all lead Ian 's lackey pull gun Gates , and gunpowder go off big explosion . ( oh , that be why spill all gunpowder ! Huh ! ! ) Ian and his henchman make their escape , and Gates and Movie Dork Riley walk nine mile subzero temperature Inuit village order stop them.To stop , Gates conclude try FBI and Super Archivist Abigail Chase ( Diane Kruger ) , Gates and Riley must steal . Riley then tell Gates excruciate detail why can notsteal Declaration , be so protect metal and laser eye and high tech security blah blah . Gates then tell Riley there be opportunity steal Preservation Room . do Riley know what Preservation Room be , Gates ask ? " place where make jam and jelly ? " be notkid ; that be actual line . Bartha do n't deliver joke , either . so Riley do all research Library Congress and Archives and water and sewage , fercryinoutloud , but do n't know what Preservation Room be . pretty much indicate what level script be on.To make rest short , Gates do fact make off D , ridiculous break-in that could only happen movie . ( also hate way depict computer monitor technology movie -- full improbable and impractical graphics and font . ) Abigail Chase end tag along convenience 's sake , and obvious " love interest " angle . one point , three , run law , discuss all their plan really loudly clothing store , surround people.A series clue and kidnapping Gates ' father , play dyspeptic Jon Voight , lead good guy and bad guy alike huge Indiana Jones fun-house locate New York City . odd subway builder never find thing . Gates and Gates Senior lead Ian off wild goose chase . Ian believe be trap cul-de-sac and leave there . however , be go , Riley ask how be go get out . gate ... ... oh boy ... ... press button and door open . no , be serious . button , might have vacu-flush lavatory office building . good thing know where be . anyway , more knob-twiddling , find immense treasure room ( remember , be all Manhattan ! ) full sort historyish golden thing . Riley get deliver really stupid line . again . and FBI officer Harvey Keitel forgive , arrest Sean Bean , and allow two chemistry-less lead get married.For viewer , think would be hard ignore all exposition , leap logic , and stereotyped character very long . its exposition involve nice history lesson insert conversation random moment . will like more conversation my life .
put movie hotel room entertain my child morning be leave go home , have pack away all their toy . ( toddler do n't like watch " Regis and Kathie Lee " or " view . " ) my four year old find one scene funny , but tell rest be " too silly .

only thing that keep vomit see movie be fact be just actor and notfreak show that usually appear TV show . be also main reason fan TV show wo n't like movie , but notonly reason . movie have about as much entertainment value get root canal . approach abyssmal depth bad movie make , and then get even bad . wo n't waste your time describe movie further detail ; suffice say pity poor camera people who have suffer watch c**p first time .
Well , Goethe once say , there really be n't point try pass negative judgement that aspire be objective " something that have have great effect " . " La Maman et La Putain " have surely pass history influence much what have be do France and elsewhere past thirty year and one interested history film , certainly , should be dissuade watch . express purely subjective judgement , however , feel compel disagree almost other review post here and say people : " do n't watch ; be waste hour your time that will just leave feel rather sick and angry . " and that do n't mean " sick and angry " " human condition " or anything general and profound as , that be exactly line most critic have adopt their fulsome praise film - " ordeal watch its ruthless dissection our emotional cowardice and cruelty " and so - and , really manage put universally or even broadly relevant message sort , then director would have good reason be satisfy , however pessimistic his conclusion may be . my beef film be rather do n't see hours-long record empty vanity and petty treachery be justify or excuse GENERALLY relevant message . three main character be deeply morally unattractive individual : Alexandre great degree , course , see far most and seldom shut up more thirty second ; Marie perhaps least degree , see least . Alexandre 's affected and pretentious monologue have kind amusement value , course , but amusement wear thin one come more and more clearly realize Jean-Pierre Laud be most likely noteven acting and , absurd remark " un homme beau comme un film de Nicholas Ray " , really be just reproduce word-for-word opinion that be accept authentic and profound milieu which , along director Eustache , have be live about ten year time making film . suppose tone relentless superficiality and triviality have be sustain 100 % film , might have work long sardonic comedy particularly shallow , worthless and despicable post-'68 milieu . what make , however , viewer least extremely angry director be his grant least one lengthy scene Alexandre and Veronika which be clearly expect empathize and feel as share moral universe . man can get away live flat and profess love one woman , sleeping ( mostly very flat ) , and run Paris propose marriage yet third , well , suppose can wish good luck dog-eat-dog world be choose create . what ca n't , however , conscience do be listen even moment maudlin monologue which speak his " anxiety " and his " despair " . same go double even more despicable Veronika , whom be show barge drunk apartment and even bed share Marie and Alexandre and behave there infantile inconsistency tantamount most savage and heartless cruelty . say , " La Maman et La Putain " be intend be nothing more nor other portrait Alexandre , Veronika and Marie , three individual whom even halfway decent person would never admit their company let alone their home , then suppose there be kind legitimacy praise director be " unflinching " ( why should even feel " flinch " have consciously opt create such thoroughly repellent character filmically observe ca n't imagine ) . problem , however , be director be clearly convince - and appear have succeed convincing generation critic - Alexander , Veronika and Marie be somehow representative human being general and limit human being ' emotional capability . latter idea , however , be arrant and offensive nonsense . there may indeed be inherent fallibility and tendency tragedy human relation general and sexual relation particular . but nature and degree fallibility and tendency tragedy can only possibly be determine people who make sincere and serious effort make such relation work . surely need cinematic or authorial genius convey information man who behave Alexandre be go end up hate , miserable , and alone , or woman who insist expect love man Alexandre be go end up disappointed and bitter . watch " La Maman et La Putain " be historically interested what pass culture and human interaction certain post-'68 Parisian milieu which be probably , unfortunately , notrestrict just few particularly anti-social type . but please do n't make mistake believe what be record here have general relevance humanity way film Jean Renoir or Martin Scorsese might be argue have .
be fan Billy Bob Thornton , and diversity his skill , notice movie list , and be surprised have n't hear it.I have travel more usual both period be be film 2000 , and when hit theater more 2-1/2 year later ( passage time be first clue all be notwell production).Now Patrick Swayze ca n't act sour apple , but Thornton have more enough ability make-up difference . and Charlize Theron be someone whom would be pleasure see , even show her watch paint dry.Being curious , check site 's production info . make whopping < $600 screen its opening weekend , and just $400 , its month 's theater run latter 2002 . overall gross be $261K , which will doubt could cover cast and crew 's hotel and food week location.The story be pretty benign , and even use usually interesting locale Reno be as dull rest goings-on.It 's something several SNL bit all piece together , none individually too great , and overall presentation even worse.Whatever , expense production have be considerable - even work less their usual fee - so one thing which make barely tolerable opus be quality film and Billy Bob 's present ( understandably somewhat laconic here , compare his usual work.Think three superb , totally diverse character portray " Sling Blade , " " Bandits " and " Bad Santa , " and know realize work be below standard , long viewer have opportunity confirm . One star , even here , and one production be good , say , typical " Lifetime " flick .
what else be leave say ? have read all review here and most be right on . . however , one person even go so far as call movie evil and Satan taint ( or something line ) . evil ? ! wow , what shocker . . mean , TBN basically make film . open your eye please.Anway , be very low grade propoghanda nonsense that have come along years.The most terrifying thing Omega Code be how much money spend make . movie can be make , there be limit , and therefore , have choice but get ready " Yentl 2 " , and " Ernest lose Omega Codes."For who be biblical story , new movie Dogma will pickup where Omega Code never start .
movie be so very badly write . character have depth . should have never make movie . my 11 Yr old son could write good screenplay then Hyung-rae Shim.The only actor that do n't suck be zoo guard . be only funny and believable one lot.I love movie and try give benefit doubt , but one be up there my lame list number 2 . number 1 be Demonicus.For who actually think be good movie , be serious need brain surgery.Most creature movie be n't even dragon ... so why do call D-war ?
just watch film 15 minute ago , and still have idea what just watch . mainly think be film Internet S&M ; " star " CD Roms that be about as realistic flash cartoon online . be murder someone , which cause her sister and crack team 2 FBI agent investigate death . local homicide division Big City , USA be also investigate , most his work come way oogling CD ROMs which claim be as realistic " real thing " . know . Wow.Michael Madsen be only one film that have kind credit . be film about 15 minute , and that be bang main girl seemingly apparent reason . wo n't even explain ending , quite frankly ca n't make . but final scene , be treat 3 or 4 minute montage everything film . honestly , could have run then final scene and would have be same effect cross eye direction and all.All , stay away film . get love bad movie and love Michael Madsen . really could have use 80 minute something else and have be more satisfy . , play game knife where jab your hand repeatedly . 80 minute would be much more entertaining .
what appalling piece rubbish ! ! ! who be all people who blubber on about how good be ? yes , be " arty " ; and yes , be " foreign " , but ... . be notenough . plot be boring and disjointed , reality show but notslickly made.The people be intrinsically uninterest ; but character do n't have enough depth feel empathy . be base real people then feel very , very sorry them.The violence ( and be very violent ) seem quite ostentatious and gratuitous . be producer have vision be Quenton Tarantino . notthink very much , either.And oh yes : have neighbour , will move !
there be really good scene Faat Kine . title character get argument woman and be threaten , Faat Kine spray face . scene work act be so unexpected , bizarre , and rather funny same time . one instance , writer/director Ousmane Sembene give audience character that be easy root , interesting film character that could be worth watching two hour . scene , present brave woman who be bold her action . rest movie , only other thing seem present be conflict tones.The tone be all place . be true notmovie have clearly fit specific genre , but do n't think Faat Kine fit genre . supposedly , be drama , there be moment such broad comedy ( aforementioned spray face ) can be take seriously . other hand , film be certainly notcomedy abundant amount serious topic Sembene have cram picture . there be way successfully mix comedy and drama together . unfortunately , Semebene do n't find balance . instead , one scene just drift other much rhyme or reason , leave two different tone hang wind.Faat Kine also have problem run two hour long extremely draw finale . film end big party where all character ' conflict be resolve , only be n't resolve quickly . scene last longer other scene , go probably twenty minute . rest scene up point have be meander , finale be particularly hard endure repetition begin early scene , make frustrating viewing experience.Perhaps be be too hard Faat Kine . be notright audience . feel nothing character and have connection part story . there be people who will probably find something meaningful story and see strong character . however , be unable do so and thus can recommend .
 Lets enter world movie second , so can well understand type movie be deal here.Edison be one really stupid movie where bad guy and his goon have be let loose 50,000 bullet shoot good guy wall and pillar , shout , and then finally get good guy face face and instead kill ... ... instead waste guy that have cause so Much grief ... .instead just walk up and POP ! ... ..What do do ? bad guy ... ..he talk . grab good guy and talk hold his gun . Have Nothing To TALK ABOUT ! shoot HIM ! shoot HIM NOW ! but talk anyway . oh thing . end , newspaper say " Pulitzer Prize Winner Story Right here " or something right front page paper , when its first time story be print . so how heezy do someone win Pulitzer fast ? yea , know type stupid movie ? yea well be Edison nutshell.You get Mr cool Morgan Freeman and shifty eyed tough Kevin spacey who phone their role completely , LL Cool J who scowl literally single moment movie,while propose his girlfriend damn night club places,and who be last line " Duck " be something lethal weapon movie that be never make ... and Justin Timberlake whine and spew nonsense time talk , little cocky bastard.The only bright spot be crazy Dylan McDermott do his good " Denzel Training Day " impression , which be pretty entertaining.Oh yea so whats movie about ? Eh , something scandal involve city Edison 's fictional special unit police force call " F.R.A.T. ( swear be notmake stuff up ) which be suppose be obvious play off S.W.A.T. Anyway little journalistic super singer boy Justin Timberflake smell something foul afoot murder involve 2 undercover cop FRAT , and go scurry off look story , gain his boss ' ( Freeman ) trust way both unravel something even big and sinister what both think . blah blah blah . its bootleg pelican brief meet halfassed training day.The pace be slow and off , script be horrible , and act be extremely uninspired . jump everywhere go anywhere . people get put coma and forget . everyone movie just do n't Think . damn what stupid movie . its become harder write sort review movie leave my brain second end ... lie basically , do notwaste your time !
Somewhere , out there , there must be list time bad gay film make . One be that have overlong camera shot star sit and stare pensively space , or be where focus unbearably long kitty kat eat spaghetti . motion sickness picture be story boy and boy and live and love and swim and get stick grotto and one have depressed mother and have mother and talk and walk and swim and have sex and get drunk and then break up and someone go hospital eight day and then get out and there be lot fast forward and rewind and there be long pensive shot one look space or just sit and do nothing . think be sort gimmicky film make technique or maybe be film be so bad have fill up long , waste shot otherwise have rely plot or story film would be about 14 minute . do n't get wrong , be about 30th gay film I"ve watch past 6 month and ( most ) have be very formulmatic , predictable and boring but be one be really terrible waste time . good so far be " beautiful thing " . so , watch and very first opening shot which linger and linger think " oh , no , its go be creative sinny mah " but give chance and watch and then when end toss DVD trash . sorry do n't like and do , sorry offend .
be difficult sit horrible heretical adaptation Sherlock Holmes . apparently Matt Frewer be cast be tall and skinny . his skull-like face make good zombie Dawn Dead remake , but Sherlock Holmes look scarecrow . notonly do Frewer have lanky lackadaisical walk that be hard watch , but look uncomfortable stereotypical Holmes overcoat be wear . notonly , but coat be gray twill apparently could notfind match cap. his cap be black and look shiny as be make polyester . whatever cap be make , look very new and artificial . Jeremy Brett occasionally wear traditional outfits , but Brett do nothave dress-up Sherlock Holmes order look part . Frewer other hand be painful watch . even full " Holmes " outfit , do notcarry Sherlock Holmes.Frewer 's cadaverous face grin all time spout and very bad " Upper-Crust " British accent be painful see and listen . say Frewer be overact be understatement . finish sentence kind nasal hum , then sneer as be kind British trait . when start watch think might be comedy feature Wishbone , Jack Russell Terrier . think Frewer have be cast kind foil Wishbone . but sadly , there be dog movie Frewer . wishbone would have make movie lot better.Not only do Frewer 's version Sherlock Holmes never stop talk ( awfully artificial British nasal accent ) , but be much friendly and kind . Frewer be always smile witness talk , and be so polite and courteous could be teach Charm School instead be Sleuth . perhaps be Hallmark Channel production , be try make child 's version Sherlock Holmes ( Wishbone be good , too ) that be kindler and gentle . whatever point Frewer 's interpretation Sherlock Holmes , be flat pancake , and easily bad version Sherlock Holmes have ever seen ( include previous bad , Charlton Heston).Overall , tone film be awful . remind typical episode Barnaby Jones or Murder Wrote or Diagnosis Murder . all suspect over-acted suspiciously and glare victim be kill . Holmes and Watson be explain clue other entire movie . even Murder Wrote there be less exposition.This Sherlock Holmes do noteven compare very well Jim Rockford Rockford Files and be mile Columbo . awful dialog be probably fault writer . be obvious who ever write script have very little familiarity Sherlock Holmes , especially BBC version Jeremy Brett . movie have atmosphere episode Little House Prairie . fact actor seem be smirk when enunciate their line their fake accent do nothelp.The only minor bright spot be Ken Walsh who play Doctor Watson dignity . Walsh do notham up compare Frewer , and when be often interview witness , his demeanor and conversational style be much more natural and credible . unfortunately , rest cast be amateurish , and visual clue give glare and make face other ( show be suspicious ) be something have notsee modern movie .
' Ninteen Eighty-Four ' be film futuristic society which government control everything and one can be trust . be very dark film , and be one that will notmake feel good . be about romance take place society and betrayal lover and about human nature be self-centred . film have very good idea and be do well portray society dark tone colour ( contrast happiness and bright colour dream ) and general feeling loneliness object and people and place . however , film 's cleverness portray idea , film be very slow and do notseem quite get idea across . seem spend too much time be clever rather tell story .
deceptive cover , title and very small hidden print Power Prayer trick rent movie.It start out really well and pull in . really like . 1/3 and 3/4 be , film start throw thing that be notset up and make sense . my first thought be , " be notwrite someone who know how tell story . " end up re-watching part movie , think have miss something.By time reach last 1/5 movie , be Boring , ANNOYING , RELIGION THUMPING DIALOG that make sense , say nothing , and be annoy listen ; turn off sound and do fast forward end.Do n't waste your time flick.Beware DVDs label Whitlow Films and Level Path Productions.And be practice Catholic .

MooCow say who cut cheese one ? ? :=8P ps - " do n't get cracker ? "
sit down watch movie my friend very low expectation . my expectation be no where near low enough . honestly could nottell what genre movie be watch , and be comedy , humor be completely miss . plot be nonexistent and act be horrendous . my friend and manage watch approximately 30 40 minute film turn off and promptly beg video store take back . do notrecommend movie anyone be purposely try watch bad movie time . honestly do n't know how film last more day theatre and moreover can notunderstand why anyone would willing watch , consider notonly be very uninterest title but also lack famous actors/actresses be cast . review be notjoke and honestly think could possibly be bad movie ever make . be certainly bad movie have ever have sit through .
movie that follow struggle actor , play , evidently , struggling actor , do favour Chris Klein . struggle bring anything memorable role and meander shallow script manage display , what could only be describe as , bland lead man . story exist , but be , and fail show basic start , middle and end and viewer be left shrug his shoulder feel nothing past hour and three quarter have really happened.One bright light midst be Fred Durst , who manage stand out his seemingly averagely talented co-star and do semi-decent job bring backward character Legde life . Fred can re-create when work high calibre cast remain be see but I'l be watch out future .
see movie last year Media class and have say really hate . be year 10 ( and age 15 ) that may have have something do . but English year , year 11 , have read Animal Farm , also George Orwell . aside fact book be base revolution , my opinion be be terrible book , and also hate it.But 1984 , think be most disturbing movie have ever see , and think George Orwell be one most derange people ever live planet . be sorry everyone who love his work , but unfortunately do not. theme movie be well portray , but way whole movie be set and event that take place be notmy standard . be only my opinion , and be sure many many other people thoroughly enjoy film .
first deserve about 5 star due act ( which would give well subjective opinion and notobjective one should give one , Well DESERVED , star ) but then i know fact be use actor(S) Names increase rating something ... i do have problem such production ; yet attempt ( just " untraceable " ) systematic propagandistic feature promote government intrusion your rights( how interest come moment when IPS provider try " preferentiate " = CENSOR information , and Americans and Canadian be fight Against very moment ) . time be notlabel torrent file transfer evil ( that one be intend remind such feeling whenever transfer datum net ) , but literally attempt create sexual frustrated population whole . seem Like Fear Promotion be Hollywood 's Norm This Days , especially when come thriller which be most " demand " motion picture genre past 2 decade or so = most view , good way try influence society whole . such level violence be depict 2 feature morally and " ethical " people , that give new much needed meaning " anti-hero " figure . make mistake , be not" Dexter " which be mean be high-quality entertainment.STOP selling " Fear " please , world would be good place and dollar make it.the opening scene and generally first 10 minute really give frightful picture Erroll Babbage that be CLEARLLY suffer sexual frustration . way handle black male be very disturbing notoutright racist(for sure " cliche " least ) ( real life someone would probably get beating , will see what i mean ) . second scene ( Claire Danes 's character present ) be even more extreme . point i realize , my opinion Erroll Babbage be very dangerous individual people him.how many people , that have see or will see movie , have never be " hold down"(regarding Both sex ) out self , Common gratification ! ?.typically movie give extreme criminal case(that unfortunately do , be and will likely happen again sometime , somewhere ) But finger everyone else indirectly as well " could become " , etc. anyone that be familiar Sigmund Freud and Jung will know very well sexuality be notsomething be judge let alone " ass " , such fanatical " hero " here . safe sex its many form be healthy and notevil apparently Richard Gere character be obsess , his way sexual " crusade " . have notlearn anything abundant recent scandal involve priest and young boy ! ? or how long American teenager can see extreme violence " pg-13 " but can noteven see woman breast " R-18 " ! ? ! ?( yet industry target VERY SAME sexual perversion " American pie " series example).raise kid tester-one level but frustrate and drive underground develop fetish unhealthy extreme ! ? sexual activities(upon mutual acceptance ) integrate individual well then " rightous " nut-case , THAT blame his misfortune and shortcoming " life others"( new German movie that would work great compare 2 distinct and world apart feature very same subject).here , movie , will probably appreciate actor well portray opposite what should have been.i be very disappoint Richard Gere especially recent " hunting party " , feature where really shine and about more realistic " hero"( real fact well).but then just remind all people be only actor that get pay play someone 's political and social agenda . " flock " and " untraceable " 2 head same hidden beast)))it just remind , know anyone similar view subject WHOLE , Erroll Babbage have here , stay clear THEIR own safety.they would kill my family faster then 0.00001 chance Paul Jerrod anyone 's life would ... end i recommend anyone think negative here about MY " assesment " particular movie ( and " untraceable " actually ) , so can likely have similar thought i do . nothing sweet then propagandistic movie shoot " foot".))))for i agree rating , be notfeature teenager or kid ; simply well would confuse even more then " common " belief " money+fame+fashion " and how relate sexuality . " scream " series and movie such AT LEAST have define entertainment value(even dumb one my opinion ) . but one be just " trust me i know what be good " deeply ( notwell do i might add ) subliminal message .
movie be extra-long tale classic novel that completely fail capture original adventure 's spirit . quite horribly American Patrick Swayze be cast British hero Allan Quatermain obviousness his nationality.The movie continue " Hollywood-ise " story change both plot and character fit more comfortably accepted mold . movie manage be predictable , even who be notfamiliar story and be plague extremely bad act and terribly disappointing fight sequences.All , terrible addition already quite bad collection movie base legend King Soloman 's Mines and Allan Quatermain .
go movie think would be neat football drama ( same vein as remember Titans ) ; however , come away feel have just attend Ted Haggard sermon rapture . only thing that be miss be request tithe end movie . actually , would probably get more out televangelist sermon poor excuse entertainment . least televangelist sermon , there be quote Scripture rather quote popularist self-help pulp . plot be entirely too predictable point anyone long-enough attention span could have lay out entire plot first 15 minute movie .
movie do notrock , other have say . find really boring and silly . story be about metal high school kid who idolize really bad heavy metal singer . singer die , but notmake one last album that be be play radio , course , midnight Halloween ( which would actually make November 1st , much less potent date be sure ) . kid get copy record and contain secret hidden back-play message . also be key that open door so really bad metal singer can return bring havoc and death world.The first part film be nothorror film , but rather School special . see metal kid ( outsider ) torment over and over popular kid . and fail learn most important lesson high school movie : when cool kid who bully suddenly invite party , do N'T Go ! be trap . especially be pool party . anybody surprise when end up water ? ? be such School special keep wait Melissa Sue Anderson show up and teach Jody Foster lesson.So back horror part film . metal kid get power and instead use kill bully boy ( which would have make much more sense ) , freak out and try protect bully boy and girl harm . what ? sensitive hero ? what fun be horror movie ? thank goodness Carrie White do notfollow lesson . actually try PREVENT have music play Halloween Dance , very music that could unleash power kill all kid who have be mean . be , would have put music , and pronto.The rest movie be about metal kid go town try kill horrible metal star idolize . why notpartner and REALLY do damage . why ask ? seem be love one popular girl and do notwant her hurt..more appropriate Molly Ringwald film . be horror film or episode Beauty and beast ? movie just go and point , scare , horror , or anything worth watching . go high school late 80s do , movie be fun have little flashback fashion and big hair , but that be film . skip and stay home and just listen Kiss .
personally , be able appreciate really good movie , also have strange ability somewhat enjoy even most crappiest crap . know , time when just want sit there and watch horrible cookie-cutter action movie kill time . be only movie can remember actually shut off middle , and have absolutely No intention go back finish . plot be so contrived and predictable , be call out what next scene would be easily ( and be usually notvery good ) . actor be horrible , have see well acting middle school play . even scene cut be bad , flow be wrong.This movie be parody that forget funny .
have see most , notLaurel & Hardy classic film . have always enjoy there comical stupidly , even watch over and over again . new film attempt bring back classic two new actor who resemble Laurel & Hardy , however fail miserably various reason . One which be how out place their cloth be ( still early 20th century ) however be portray 90 be set . former dialogue be bring back , however also fail miserably come close classic series . film could very well be bad film have ever see and should be pull off shelf and lock away forever . real Laurel & Hardy be surly spinning their grave such bad imitation .
This start off bad , what three woman act simper junior high school wussies sit giggle their gin , endless cigarette and caramel chocolate treat one who tell good ' man ' story , and then get bad -=- spoiler alert =-= what Andie 's character fall young organ player who use be her student when be 14 ( be headmistress English school , believe or not) , only have destroy thanks her bitch-from-hell ' girlfriend ' . ..and then there , be basically unwatchable claptrap : forgive ' friend ' and have organ player 's love child and 3 woman end up start , drink more gin and smoke more cigarette blah blah blah .

and how make production astound . main character be obnoxious show who be n't least bit funny . ca n't stand character . be dumb ass nothing offer show.This be bad cartoon surface last 10 year , joke . story line be poorly write and execute . joke be as bad one Disney 's Sweet Life Zack and Cody . could notdislike show more , be terrible and should be cancel . even theme song be bad . title , even worse.It be as show be write couple 15 year old that base character and think be hot stuff when be really just arrogant and lack creativity as well humor.Johnny test , go away far and fast !
 Witchcraft/Witchery/La Casa 4/ and whatever else wish call . how about..Crud.A gathering people Massachusetts island resort be besiege black magic power evil witch kill individual use cruel , torturous method . photographer Gary(David Hasselhoff)is take picture Linda(Catherine Hickland whose voice and demeanor resemble EE-YOR Winnie Poo cartoon ) , virgin study witchcraft , island resort permission . Rose Brooks(Annie Ross , portray incredibly rude bitch)is interested perhaps purchase resort and , husband Freddie(Robert Champagne , who be always ogle other woman much young ) , pregnant daughter Jane(Linda Blair)and grandson Tommy(Michael Manchester , who just look bore , probably want watch Sesame Street instead star rubbish ) , go boat resort be treat look property Realtor Tony Giordano 's son Jerry(Rick Farnsworth ) , obviously pup business get his foot wet . folk be architect Leslie(Leslie Cumming , whose character be nympho)who might help Rose re-design resort . boat 's captain be kill Lady Black(Hildegard Knef , wear her make-up and lip-stick extra thick)and storm be brew . boat drive off itself(..guided invisible power Lady Black , I guess)with everyone stick decrepit resort , which be dire need repair . most victim , meet their grisly fate be carry type red wormhole whose vortex lead dimension(..perhaps type hell or something)where be torture fiend dress raggedy clothes crummy visage . One victim have her mouth sow be hang upside down chimney , roast other light fireplace . One poor soul be torture harsh twistings rope wrap tightly her flesh be find hang snout swordfish penetrate her neck .

Blair 's pregnant victim become possess her hair standing end speak woman 's voice . be rape demonic man " diseased " mouth hellish hobo stand nearby gleefully cheer . film , 's excess , be mostly dull fodder who really wish see low point career Hasselhoff and Blair , who deserve good . almost unbearable time , build little-to-no suspense . clumsy execution death sequence which look cheap and laughable . sure gore be okay , but most film show victim have be run ringer . do get chance see pregnant women(..who look exactly like stuntmen costume bad wig ) jump out three story window . oh , and Lady Black 's reflect face often pop up inanimate object character see . Tommy have little Sesame Street recorder which tape Lady Black 's mumbo jumbo chant , obviously use later . reason , Lady Black like visit little Tommy . be notscared , Tommy 's just too bore show expression his face , much less fear . need say more ? one be real stinker . Ugh .
ca n't believe Steven Segal 's career have hit so low have be reduce make 4th rate film 5th rate secondary actor . watch moving expect see beet crap out people way usually do . when be reduce use single judo chop shoulder blade take out opponent and guy fall ton brick something be wrong.The plot be unbelievable movie , and even excuse visual , and have read story novel , will be leave wonder why have even pick up book.Steven Segal go motion and seem as be only do be obligation . show effort and enthusiasm , and scene do n't show up all.I hate repeat other people comment , but use stock footage cut scene and visual aircraft flight be pathetic . condition scene chop , be shaky and scene seem have deteriorate time . zappruder film show President John F Kennedy be assassinate be steady and cleaner.My honest opinion be tell notwaste your time see movie , be notup standard his work glimmer man or exit wound . read one review that say movie have 12 million dollar budget ( Segal be pay 5 ) and movie still come budget . must concur.It be wonder be direct DVD movie , conscientious theatre owner would play movie .
Dark REMAINS be low budget American horror movie that somehow manage win 2 awards.The plot seem involve 2 separate strand . first , woman commit suicide slash her wrist bath . second , young daughter technical writer be find her throat slash . grieve couple decide move isolated cabin mountain . later transpire cabin and surround location be haunted.As movie go , 2 separate strand story eventually converge might reasonably expect . however , execution be haphazard and result confusion that could perhaps only be resolve multiple viewing . unfortunately , movie be simply notentice enough attract most viewer watch more once.Just everything that could go wrong movie go wrong - and fast ! and low budget can be use justify shortcoming find here.I believe would be wrong pass judgement actor involve production material be simply too poor.The character be uninterest as point out other reviewer site . badly write script introduce too many people give interesting dialogue , create opportunity character-driven situation and add depth them.The direction be uninspired . inspiration J-Horror movie such RINGU , GRUDGE and One MISSED CALL be evident . unfortunately , director Dark REMAINS do notpay close attention style J-Horror . J-Horror work so effectively play fear unknown . tension be create constant shift bizarre situation ( ghost CCTV camera walk example ) , and reaction central character who be face warning . there be humour or tongue-in-cheek element movie . everything be play so straight and remorse or limitation ca n't help but be convince and captivate . foreboding atmosphere set up suspense and ensure horror have psychological impact , very much " jump scare " use Hollywood movies.The director Dark REMAINS make brave attempt avoid Hollywood clichs and also successfully avoid use CGI . homage J-Horror could have be well intend . unfortunately , lack inspiration be likely make viewer laugh supposed " scare " screen . make-up effect " ghost " be n't too bad give low budget but their action just defy logic . be scratch my head quite few time movie.I could n't give away end even want . simply could n't understand . all could deduce be be something anti-climax.What remain ? answer reviewer different website have point out be boredom . movie be chore sit through . thankfully , pain end hour and half . however , most would probably switch off long end.There be only 2 positive thing could find movie - successful avoidance scare clichs and absence " f-word " single sentence one would normally expect find . be what 2 star be for.Those who like supernatural or psychological horror relate ghost and haunting might do well stick movie such Legend HELL HOUSE , CHANGELING or J-Horror sub-genre.If think have see too many established movie and want see obscure ultra-low budget " R-rated " horror movie ghost , watch Death GHOST Hunter . may notbe great horror movie ever make but be surely lot well Dark REMAINS and do have few genuine surprise store.I advise everyone avoid Dark REMAINS plague .
will spend few day dedicate Ron Howard swear off his work entirely . have , unfortunately , deal Lucas such young age , Howard be now catch up so many Lucas ' trait . how else do explain his rampage disaster ? his only useful film , course , have be ' Willow ' . everything else , include , be too reliant superficial junk.Some spoilers.He ca n't even have semi-intelligent focus Peter Weir . no , poor Howard so stick his Spielbergian knockoff quality will be quickly forgotten.Here have old adage : " love conquer all , even disease . " too bad Howard Lynch already get whole subtext more skill . heck , even Disney do good . Ron even goof up possibility present imagine realities.Howard 's commentary track be just awful . do n't even rent DVD.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud
not sure why film be advertise wild , quirky , laugh fill comedy . there be notmuch movie that will entertain , nor amuse moviegoer . Annette Bening ( whose acting be tout be Oscar worthy ) come off here as mannered , her performance seeming routine . Brian Cox 's character be confuse and irritate , and lead play Augusten Joseph Cross appear simply nothave personality carry his role . good thing film be Evan Rachel Wood , but be notenough endorse boring , unsavory film.The film disappear quickly and seem good reason . find scene distasteful ( scene Brian Cox and his just utilize toilet rival bad scene in ' and Me and Everyone Know ' and ' The Squid and Whale ' ) , embarrassing , and most unsettling . find whole experience waste time . do n't waste your time
see movie today Haifa Film Festival Israel hear rave review , but guess critic be just suck up Willem Defoe and his wife ( director ) who be present festival . be definitely slow movie have ever see numerous pointless , ridiculously long scene nothing . Defoe who be decent , acting two and half other people movie , Defoe 's wife Giada include , be ridiculously awful ( how cast part salesgirl bakery be ) . movie be pretty much plot less lame attempt be abstract and off wall . only scene that stir kind reaction crowd be vulgar and come nowhere as just add kind shock value dullness that be movie . sorry be so harsh , but really movie be precious waste time and money . appreciate good indie cinema , but movie be notworthy moviegoer ' time .
Saw screener before last year 's Award season , do n't really know why give out voting have end , but whatever , maybe exposure , least , but movie be convoluted mess . sure , part be funny black humor kind way , but none character feel very real . there be notone person could connect , and think be where fail . sure , plot be somewhat interesting and very subversive Scientology , WOW ! what grand idea ... let be see that already have n't be mine point futility . whole ordeal feel fake , lighting , casting , screenplay horrible visual effects(which be suppose be intentional , can tell , and so can everyone else , one be laugh ) . anyways , hope make out sale DVD least , would n't want project lot people obviously put lot effort get completely unnoticed . but be tripe either way . boring tripe .
 Good:Effective color scheme . good costume . top notch set production . well detailed CGI building and vehicles.The Bad:Horrible mixture actor CGI actor mix Fifth Element Final Fantasy . CGI actor look even bad video game few year ago . flawed logic . giant pyramid show up and one research , no one really even question ? and there be explanation why god Horus be even cast out , nor be there reason why must do something trivial impregnate Jill ? Ugly:Awful script . many unnecessary subplot too many idea that be notfully realize . dialog be almost laughable point . random character and event that be notneed . dull character . Jill be suppose be mystery , but apparently be just mystery writer . there be nothing . be uninterest and bore watch . have substance , texture . her character have redeeming quality . fact , there be notone character entire film who have purpose , goal ( obvious one Horus ) , motivation . be weak and ill-conceived . there be stake - key screen writing . Horus will notbecome immortal , but , big deal , be bad guy . can even decipher Horus or Jill be main character . be problem : devote half movie character mean writer never fully explore one character , never bring fruition . be cardboard cut-out who walk around and talk and pretty much do nothing but explore fine set piece . first time director pace . slow , slow , slow . be still watch movie write . can pay attention be boring . everything be flat . even action be notinteresting be short-lived and sometimes unnecessary.Overall:Not worth watch . threadbare story , sub-par character development , corny CGI do notsave nice set production .
Ned Kelly ( Ledger ) , infamous Australian outlaw and legend . sort Robin Hood , mix Billy kid , Australian love legend how stand up English aristocratic oppression , and unite low class change Australia forever . fact low class time be around 70 % immigrant criminal seem be casually skim around film . indeed , quite few so call ` fact ' film be , reflection , tad dubious.I suppose suspicion should have be arouse when , opening credit , be claim film be base book , ` Our Sunshine ' . ever romanticize version truth could be see name book , there be . be n't go be historical epic , but just adaptation one many dubious legend Ned Kelly , harsh and sporadically brutal version.Unfortunately , Ned Kelly be nothing more overblown Hallmark channel ` real life historical drama ' wannabe ! story plod along alarming rate ( alarm never have film plod so slowly ! ) feeling numbness two hour pure drivel bring back memory Costner 's awful Wyatt Earp all year ago . simply put , nothing happen film , but take long time get nothing . would possibly have be tad more bearable performance be good ( direction sure heck be n't ) . however , be look play game spot bad Oirish accent , then be gonna be disappoint . , game ` who have stupid beard ? ' , ` Spot obvious backstabber ! ' ( clue , be ginger reason ) , and ` Nature Australia.including lion ' , be experience similar flick Hallmark , history Channel , Discovery Channel , and Neighbours suffer huge hangover . Yup , nature pop up lot , as fill even more time ( possibly attempt look arty ) , film keep show pointless wildlife shot , and once all native specie be show , here be circus allow camel and lion ( which be use one fight try make actually feel more sorry lion massacre people).This be turgid , emotionless piece historical fluff which should have go straight TV . there be n't even one good word can say film . even usually fantastic rush seem embarrass be here . when one character comment there be only 2 bullet leave and his pal , be wish have gun blow memory film out my head !
This be easily bad Presley vehicle ever , which would bring pretty close bad film ever make . be measurably bad even revolting " Happy Ending " song end " happen World 's Fair " , and here think moment when Elvis buy vendor 's balloon his girl , and then balloon vendor get jiggy march band be epitome bad cinema and could notbe top . usually enjoy random Elvis flick other reason but memory time when be innocent enough sit . one , however , ought be call " live Little , Wish be Dead Little " , and make " Stay Away Joe " look Olivier play Othello.Here , Elvis play Greg , who be essentially hippie free-lance photographer Establishment haircut . fun morning reckless driving , end up beach where be abduct woman who be name change depend scene and who be speak . clearly Michele Carey be select her resemblance and ability mimic Elizabeth Taylor ( watch my glass , would have think be late 1960 's Liz play female lead ) . sic her dog Elvis run water and catch convenient movie pneumonia , then keep dope up consciousness her beach pad so long lose his job and his apartment move his stuff her house awaken even tell ( audience do notknow either , Elvis try go back work and his boss have beat up reason deserve make movie , and try go home and find hateful woman slip living his house).Rather have arrest kidnapping , larceny and assault , go out and get two job repay back rent Miss Crazy Pants have spring when steal his belonging . job one be work Don Porter Playboy type magazine , job two be upstairs work Rudy Vallee snobby fashion magazine . think two-job shuffling be suppose be comedy , too bad be n't least bit funny , will laugh 100th time see someone run up and down stair fast-motion silly music . predominate obstacle that keep Greg fall his abductor be her other love interest , dreadfully miscast Dick Sargent ( let be face , either Porter or Vallee , even give their advanced age 1968 , would have make far more believable competitor Miss Crazy 's affections).There be variety uninteresting and unfunny twist and turn , keep wait something , anything happen that would make make sense . never do .

be n't expect much film- fun little diversion . wuthering Heights could be turn plausible modern story- nice and soapy , melodramatic and intriguing . but film decide throw away talent people involve simper version so water down source material be amazing have gut call Wuthering Heights . ignore fact be story people who be essence unlikeable , mostly unsympathetic , and frequently cruel one . change very nature certain characters- Isabelle , instance , novel , have notconnive bone her body- have strip her blind idealism and turn scheming whore . Heathcliff be awful person who psychologically torture most people his path , but version Catherine end leave her daughter his care . dialog be trite and one wonder how actor manage deliver straight face . place depth or actual emotion , know mean something when scream someone 's face . have read criticism early 90 's version , " Emily Bronte 's Wuthering Heights " which feature Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche , say turn intensely dark , Gothic story sudsy bodice-ripper . slightly valid comment , but MTV version go step further , use basic story structure deliver chipper beach bum cavort really bad music .
Buck 's role Kahn bring mind Bob Barker ( price be right ) run country same way run his show . but there be lots more chuckle and snort through turkey . Kurt Thomas baby-faced " hero " display considerable acrobatic skill , but notwhit act talent whatsoever . there be few spooky moment ( Village Crazies , mostly ) , and mildly impressive martial art sequence . but give " Ninja " movie will give much more entertainment , and wo n't feel as guilty laugh .

surely Saturday morning TV kid ' show be ever do poorly . , producer have count audience come back . well , awful offering , could least count money save set . script could have be reject long-forgotten space opera serial , few smarmy line add cool-dude Gerald Mohr murmur Naura Hayden . director could have do anything decent such loony storyline , so action just plod boringly along . spaceship prop be absurd--a Bulova wall clock and portable typewriter , example--but planet set have get be bad cinematic history . most be crude drawing , and be all bath often misfocused red light . even Mohr 's bare hairy chest be use prop . and be bad one--as rib-thin plot . viewer who can make end movie will hear message Martians--and will probably agree completely !

Film critic world , apologize . be your job give advice moviego public so can wisely choose what spend money . but ignore your advice and have be deeply hurt . however , my decision see " Cat Hat " be n't make haphazardly . see , three year ago all critic say should all avoid " calamity " know " how Grinch Stole Christmas " . then friend take see and turn out be colorful , funny and almost hypnotic yuletide treat . so when critic unleash their fury " Cat Hat " , big budget Seuss update big name star title role , think must be same old song . how wrong was.For five whole minute think be clear . opening credit be clever , kid be charming and production value be top notch . then cat show up . there be many problem point , but big be woeful miscast Mike Myers . where " Grinch " be save inspired casting Jim Carrey , " Cat " be destroy Myers . can be very funny when his energy be apply where belong , comic sketch . movie have make be truly funny be really just feature length comedy sketch , " Wayne 's World " " Austin Powers " . so try do same thing here , be just comedy sketch be more stuff stick end SNL , notfunny , just painful . notwriter help . charming prologue movie turn hour repulsive bodily humor gag , poorly time pratfall and insultingly stunt attempt hip humor . movie be most dishearten cinematic experience have ever have . period . much talent and work go something so vile . know adult star movie will be relatively unscathed mess , just hope wonderful Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning will get more chance show their charm far good movie . be parent , please avoid plague . movie " Elf " and " Brother Bear " currently theater , have far good choice .

 ===minor spoilers===I be , many other , huge Jerry Bruckheimer fan . so when see all beautiful poster hang out front , and trailer come MI:2 , expectation be rise . Jerry Bruckheimer production . big car . Nic Cage and fresh Oscar- Angelina Jolie . what can possibly go wrong ? lot.The script be neither funny ( which try really hard be ) nor exciting . put black person who be constantly make racist joke and Wooh-haa ! ! have get comedy ? do n't think so . excitement be totally out picture . first ( and be probably say many time ) there be sympathetic character who care who get kill ? can stomach premise psycho be gonna kill Nic 's brother steal 50 car 4 day , next thing know be Kip ( brother ) be walk Nic street again . be excitement ? think not. then come good bit- romance Nic and Angelina . actually look bore have utter all stupid line Nic . ' do have girlfriend ? ' ' be see anybody ? ' ' what go wrong ? ' etc.Then there be only one sparkle hope left : car chase . be disappointing say least , trailer make look be full , and there be only one . very long one , catch irritatingly hectic camera movement . really have trouble follow action.So be action movie ? thriller ? romantic comedy ? - there be need decide , just avoid horrible mess . will give 3 out 10 star , and feel be be generous .

Carlos Mencia be funny and stupid poster , actually have fan and his show be air be sorry your redneck who doese n't get his joke . please give my 20 minute my life back .
as soon hit screen , destroy intelligent life form around ! but behalf its producer must say do n't fall know movie category , deserve brand new denomination its own ! be " neurological drama " ! sadden and depress single neuron person 's brain.It be close thing will ever get stroke actually suffer one . drive speechless , all member go numb , your mouth fall open and remain so , and most strange symptom be get wish go blind and deaf.No small feat such sort " movie".The only word that come my mind just have finish my ordeal be OUTRAGE ! ! ! ! ! !
have always want see love cheesy horror movie and title , be sure " incredible Melting man " would be lot fun.It really be n't . mean , act be entertainingly bad , script contain classic bad line and special effect look someone have sneeze all lead actor , so should have love . unfortunately be really draggy highlight . decide watch last half movie do my tax return . be how boring film is.Nevertheless , love bad movie will enjoy dramatic exit Fat Nurse , and stellar acting guy who play Dr. Ted . be fair poor man , do have deliver amazingly inept line straight face - conversation have his wife track down I M Man:"I will find Geiger counter . " " be radioactive ? " " just little bit."Yes , plot have Dr. Ted wander try find superstrong zombie kill machine arm only what look mini-Dyson . be brave man . unfortunately his plan fail when find big lot goop tree . " oh god - be his ear ! " say Dr. Ted audience . be so glad clear up.I realise be make movie sound rather fun . would be be only 10 minute long , but unfortunately go and , and incredible Melting Dude just dangle make sticky mess when should be eat more people my opinion . think be truly stone would probably love , just do n't have pop-tarts movie , lead actor really do resemble end .
 Yes there be bad movie there . most make fun , shoe string budget , or t.v. movie week , but even be ' movie week ' would rate no more two star . be poor movie serious subject feature abused woman who flee king slime people protective arm king wussy people . ( be attempt show do n't need man protect wuss man be superfluouse film and ought notbe ) . have suspense , character development , and heroine that could be outsmart rotton onion . ( think flush her wedding ring boat self contain tank rather just drop overboard ocean ( where her body should be anyway ) and husband find , demonstrate be moron , still make childish assumption that lead almost get kill . ) be always amaze when see sort generally high rating movie get and make realize Dr. Seuss still have huge untapped market people who would be challenge his work . get do laughting humanity weep .
have read novel see film , be enormously disappoint wooden acting and arrogance producer their blatant disregard plot . feel film way reflect brilliance Bronte 's work , and rather give impression shallow love story . condense film short 2hours , film lose many key feature which make book comprehendable and progressional , thus result somewhat jumpy plot little grounding . there be no build up romance Rochester and Jane Eyre , so appear rather abrupt and unfounded two character have such infrequent interaction can help but imagine their ' love ' be superficial . be such injustice Bronte 's novel ; be give impression Jane 's quirky cheek and boldness which attract Rochester , and his arrogance which attract Jane him.Despite poor script , think few character be portray very astutely , namely Mrs Fairfax and Grace Poole , however overall production be poor . give good script , perhaps film would have be more successful . see " Jane Eyre " ( 1970 ) Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton outstanding production .
rend movie title " exterminator year 3000 , " odd be good know what be get . be sell promising description " nuke mutant , " " motor-psychos , " and course " exterminator " which , accord back movie-store case , be all cavort post-apocalyptic barren wasteland wreak sort mayhem . let wacky hijinks and low budget buffoonery ensue--at least , such be my hope " film."Now like occasional terrible movie , and be read comment exterminator Year 3000 , probably do too . be say , rate film solid " 1(awful)"--not completely hate film but be one most legitimately dreadful effort movie-making have ever see . dialogue , acting , cinematography , sound-editing , edit general , plot , etc. , etc. , etc--all be worthy what must surely be low spectator expectation give marvelous title.So what be really " good " bad movie ? do have several what my circle affectionately term " quality kill . " quality kill , few unfamiliar phrase , be n't hard and fast term , but general refer someone kill particularly gruesome , creative , or ridiculous fashion.Exterminators Year 3000 also have fair supply " dialogue-so-bad-it-becomes-funny , " provide great part Crazy Bull , aptly title leader hapless motor-psycho gang--who incidentally also provide most quality kill ( be hope big thing nuke mutant , think again , play essentially zero part movie ... shuck ! ) . Crazy Bull , however , be could ask B-movie motor-psycho . Shakespearean paraphrase and oddly PG-style insult be all know how say ... and that be terrific.Despite its quality kill and bad dialogue , however , be look truly entertaining bad movie , exterminator year 3000 do disappoint somewhat its draw limit thing silly and outdated special effect , quality killing , and bad dialogue , there be simply notenough justify full feature length , owe principally forty minute or so which audience be force follow character protracted and boring car " chase " and long desert hike sequence ... , pretty good awful movie , but hey , be death Race 2000 .
not exactly my genre , straight-to-DVD street fight action be one only encounter due friend put have few beer . be relatively open mind , and quite fan Eamonn Walker , so sit back ready enjoy myself.Blood and Bone be story Isiah Bone , ex-con who become street fighter unclear reason which eventually unfold film progress . blah blah blah.What tedious film . understand film like do n't rely hugely plot , but do have stuff such silly , predictable and entirely stupid storyline ? may notbe important , but golly gum do annoy . well plot and pure action clche-ridden fleabag mongrel narrative . infuse entirely unfounded and unachieving sentimental drivel , be cinematic equivalent thin-skinned turkey stuff rotten innards . should probably point mention what be , course , film 's drawing point : fighting . even , fighting be rather poor . bone manage take out well establish tough-man street fighter single punch ( large oaf or two be filmmakers ' laughworthy attempt rectify inconsistency ) ; fighter who never seem conclude attack one one be foolish ploy . even be repetitive and stupid , arm break and face kick steady alacrity get see time and time again.A run mill , film-by-numbers movie which fully deserve its straight DVD status , do absolutely nothing new and everything have see time and time again . and noteven particularly well .
" Everything great documentary could be " ? ? yeah , be deaf , dumb , and blind . everything but meaning , wit , visual style , and interesting subject matter . aside . . .Seriously , volken . be movie that be completely inauthentic . adventure doc adventure , war doc feeling war , campy send-up trace wit . mean nothing , feel nothing , and carry implicit message absolutely nothing matter . wonder have so many IMDb fan ! course , go know movie star great Skip Lipman will have culture , intelligence , wit ( other corrosive adolescent jokiness ) , and recognizable human emotion just adrenaline . " Darkon " be n't movie -- be panic attack ! avoid . there too many real documentary and too little time life waste toilet build-up such " Darkon " .
right away , film be ridiculous . notdo n't have redeeming aspect example , good thing film be beautiful background scenery . anyone notlive East Coast should know South do n't have beautiful mountain find West . know be Utah right bat , but perhaps Dalton could n't suppress his English accent , so have excuse say be southern town . subvert his accent Southern one be easy . sure film have plot twist , but its phony sense place be something could n't get past . be notUtah do n't have meth lab ... so why writer think necessary pretend be South be me.One other thing action picture always puzzle . why do always make " cock " sound effect when character pull out automatic handgun ? seem other sound effect movie be " chuk-chich " signify 9mm be load and ready fire . course , weapon already have round chamber be unnecessary.Lastly , pyrotechnics be WAY top . but hey , film be target certain ' market segment ' suppose ... be too bad . actor can act , but film be lame .
see movie Edmonton International Film Festival , great Dr. Uwe Boll attendance.The film be , simply put , very , very bad . and no , notusual Uwe Boll " so bad be actually entertaining " way , but just plain bad . plot concern man who lead terrible life ( past criminal record , apparently ) , ca n't get job , and awful 900 pound cheating wife . man turn his cult-leader uncle plan steal truck load toy that contain bird flu virus . Al Qaeda also have design steal toy , and what follow be just two hour completely incomprehensible sex and violence.The acting be awful ( Dave Foley , who really try , all ) , joke never rise child be shoot chest slow motion , and people take poo . be suppose be satire , but be notsure what.Think " Airplane ! " , but do creator South Park , and joke .
 Curiosity lead " masterpiece " . unfortunately , do n't rent , buy ! most disturbing thing film be be notdisturbing . reason know only , maker film set out show human side Jeffry Dahmer . be kid ? man give new meaning term " finger lickin ' good " ! and all flash-backs and flash-forwards have trouble follow story . Jeremy Renner 's performance be n't too bad . can catch " S.W.A.T. " , which play disgruntled ex-cop . anyway , would rate negative . only get 1 Renner 's so-so performance . there be plenty book and tv documentary there that do much good job cover Dahmer 's crime . avoid one .
Julia Stiles be talented young actress , who guidance reputable agent have lot potential . obviously , person who guide travesty be notsomeone who care anything her career . sit theater surround teenager who leave drove find movie sneak wonder who think movie would appeal anyone . be poorly write , casting director could only have put 1 or 2 minute effort character and director obviously do n't care .
This may sound crazy even people who remember show ... but remember as being live-action . do n't think ever see cartoon . but movie ? maybe . remember very clearly . guy be building kinda showroom . even have red jacket . be dark and turn red car and there be guy second level look down . car/guy spin around and crash big showroom type window and out street . and then proceed drive off . be remember . really hope someone else there remember too . not, maybe be still crazy . but be hope be not.
unfortunately have agree critic write halopes.For short film cinematography , costume , set , sound , edit and everything else be very , very good . might seem surprising first but be tell technical crew work consist professional , so quality be be expect . problem , usual , reside story itself.Thing be , be notreally story . tell story ( or cinema 's case , Show story ) need plot and conflict . need thing that happen protagonist : event . event happen protagonist want something and , reason , ca n't get . Tim Watcher have problem or goal . be kind supernatural entity who observe mankind . be . so what have here be pure exposition . instead be show story , be simply learn thing Tim Watcher individual . course , consider peculiar nature Tim Watcher and film 's short duration , be hard give enough background movie resort Voice-Over Narration . case be use bad possible sense which be give information otherwise will never glean . fact , be n't VO will think character be just kooky old man go look thing . make bad VO also explain what be happen screen ! image be show be just decoration text be listen to.I could say short film would make good video band or something , but image do n't stand their own be impossible say . what be leave obviously have value measure crew 's technical capability ( notincredible , but good ) but fail entertain , amuse , thrill or , very least , show story .
think shot and lighting be very poor . when watch first time think be old version(1956 ) . when really find out true year film be shock . do n't know there could be such bad film make so recently . Thats really all want say . film have good plot though , nothing could n't miss out would simply read novel George Orwelll write . all really want say have already be say : ca n't believe film could have possibly receive many award and nominations.I give film One ( awful ) , feel be very badly make . well be all . long
movie be maybe one most boring movie 2000 have see ! especially music fail create suspense when people suddenly disappear . also aspect such martial law be nottreat necessary seriousness . story have problem : UN could never take power world United States alone would notallow but nation such China , Russia , Japan , etc. would noteither . would also play someone try take world Nicolae Carpathia do . remind James Bond movie , only have more action ! naturally movie be make Christian and only Christian and may enjoy . can count Christian find whole idea ludicrous . prophecy furthermore seem be , believe be true , dangerously close other prophecy cult end world . why fear such possibility when can make life good possible here Earth
initial 20 minute or so ( be watch PS2 have really idea how long take ) alienator set up interesting premise . do n't think have see slasher movie alien planet baddie before . however , interest soon turn stun disbelief realise ' alien ' be huge body-builder woman steel bikini . yes , Alienator be patently ridiculous.Do n't think hold . world shlock-horror , patently ridiculous can often be good sign . however , blatant stupidity its premise be all movie really have go . alienator be funny hell , but be also shambolic suckfest high order . actor heap fail attempt seriousness , potentially genius line pure cheese dialogue be stumble over unnerve incompetence and direction fail sum up even one or two decent set-pieces . time movie have finish can barely see original concept haystack total tripe team pile it.Add fact ' Alien ' just kill people vaporise , as oppose do ' slash ' such and have giant throb heap good idea be leave rot . will laugh alienator , but AT , not. be your thing then go ahead and check out .
yet again one most misunderstood goddess my country have be twist " Westerners " who can understand esoteric symbolism Mother Goddess her dark form . Mother take frightening form Kali Mata destroy our inner demon , and terrify our ego . and blood sacrifice be give Kali and Durga , event depict film be just absurd . Mother take wrathful form be wrathful our inner demon , limitation , and ego when other form will suffice . be also her wrathful form burn away all your Karmas " Smashan " fire that cultivate your heart dance love , and will bring reality and truth . reality and truth have dark side as well light , which serve purpose . Mother be embodiment physical universe well , be nature . nature can be cruel and destructive maintain balance . can have growth and life death and destruction . Kali represent force destruction purpose new growth and life both mundane and spiritual universe . be very outrageous people who know nothing India or 's divinity can just take our beloved goddess and use cheap prostitute make low-budget , talentless horror film . how dare take our beloved Mother and portray horror that make people chop their eyelid off ! ? be only horrific who be attach their ego and who live delusion , greed , anger , and other inner-demons . be very clear person who write movie must have very serious self-deluding ego , and serious inner-demons see Kali so horrible and terrible . when ego drop away become form that be enchanting , beautiful , and young , beauty that be so enchanting behold enchant entire universe . Kali Maa be ancient Mother , notbe trifle sake entertainment , let 's just hope her endless compassion and mercy do nottake wrathful form involve movie.The audacity westerner have use religion my own , or religion Caribbean Islands such Santeria , and Vodou which be actually very positive , and other such religion twist and exaggerate misunderstand element Western mind can comprehend , be totally ridiculous . be clear there be respect what people live , breathe and believe when come kind flicks.Kali Maa reality be caring and compassionate mother , whom shed tear her beautiful foot devotion and love . and be happy my Mother take wrathful form sometimes protect her devotee and outside forces.Many praise REAL Kali Maa , who have show Many path God and realization .

Very bad . very , very bad . fellow who aspire make , be in or - least - sniff catering table movie set , find hard criticize independent who actually get movie sort make . however , movie ... oh dear.Realizing Frightworld do n't aspire anything more crude exploitation ( honorable thing ) and try make conform more mainstream standard be mistake . and be fair , be more entertaining - say - Red Zone Cuba ... but notmuch . so wo n't try critique , just let ask throw out observations.1 ) gore be point movie , should n't be able see ? 2 ) have hire three sound man make sure least know how operate equipment.3 ) horror movie your lead maniac must be scary smurf doll . difficult know but really ... 4 ) there be lot talented videographers Buffalo/Rochester area , most can hire really cheap . get who know how frame scene.5 ) just have someone who know how use effect and other cool program do n't mean should do two seconds.6 ) Kudos get girl take off their top but next time , get girl who be tops want see take off.7 ) Editing should help tell story or set mood . least sort movie edit should sell gore gag . chainsaw suddenly appear character stomach be notscary , be sloppy.Some good thing . notall act be bad . Jack be pretty good and like Acid start fight back . there be neat imagery , unfortunately be throw up screen rhyme or reason . " acid Poptart " be name that deserve good movie . like moxie Frightworld too . next time , now have movie sort their belt , hope all involve aspire something good Colman Francis . upgrade least Ed Wood .
be tag-line " tradition American Pie " that fool rent movie . what get be piece junk style Jackass , major difference compare jackass movie seem Citizen Kane.This movie make regret reward other movie 1 out 10 , now ca n't go . one make quite bad movie look cinematic feats.I actually turn off 45 minute , and be something very rarely do . but be just too plain boring , stupid , uninteresting and unnecessary.Ca n't believe people actually reward 10 out 10 . what do your parent do ? drop head when be just child ? or be very first movie ever see , so get nothing compare ? be still virgin and be breast all ever think off ? something must be wrong , least.My advice : stay clear one . even your mood simple movie that do n't require think , choose something else , or will regret sure .
be eager see " Mr. Fix " be huge David Boreanaz fan . what get , though , be 1-1/2 hour nap . premise seem enjoyable : Boreanaz be Lance Valenteen , proprietor business call " Mr. Fix " , where dump man enlist his help get their girlfriend take back.Among problem movie be edit , script , and act . have find Boreanaz delightful his other film role ( exception " Crow " movie do ) , be disappointing . time , his character be interesting and other , flat . supporting cast remind soap opera day player . realize be n't big-budget film , but scene cut and music just do n't seem right.My advice : watch your own risk .
main reason people still care " Carlton-Browne F.O. " be feature Peter Sellers second-billed role . but watch film see Peter Sellers be mistake.Sellers play Amphibulos , vaguely reptilian prime minister dirt-poor island nation Gaillardia , formerly British colony , now host lot Russian digger height Cold War . Amphibulos want play U.K. and Soviet interest other easy profit , " everything very friendly and all our card table " . Terry-Thomas be title character , lazy British diplomat anxious show Gaillardia Great Britain have n't forget , appearance contrary.A positive review here say : " reason movie be consider average be comedy be understate . " would argue reason " Carlton-Browne " be consider average be comedy be non-existent.After decent opening that establish film be only two strength , sympathetically doltish Terry-Thomas and John Addison 's full-on larky score , thing quickly slow down series slow burn and lame miscommunication joke . low opinion Carlton-Browne his boss and obscurity Gaillardia ( which one can find map ) be milk death . time actually reach island ( labored series airsick joke ) , expectation be quite low.They be still too high , though . island , which seem exist either Latin America or Mediterranean , be so pathetic its honor guard faint airport , and review stand fall apart middle parade . army be apparently still horse draw , allow lame aural gag thick-accented announcer : " war , army use many horse."Sellers never quite take center stage even when be his character 's island . plot be take over instead Ian Bannen King Loris , who inherit throne Gaillardia his father 's assassination . Bannen be dull and play his part as straight be write . normally would make likely target scene-stealing Sellers , but trap thick accent and greasy moustache , Sellers be only threat who remember far more happily two other film make same year , " Mouse Roared " and " be Right , Jack."Strange film , " Jack " , be Boulting Brothers production , Roy Boulting here serve co-director Jeffrey Dell . usually Boulting film combine wicked social satire anything-goes comedy , but here there be only fey jab direction . Amphibulos work his mangled-English vibe all its worth ( " man be like , how do say , bull Chinese ship " ) Carlton-Browne be generally ragged his superior far more seem deserve.The weak and most protracted element film be young Loris 's romance Ilyena . score one point her be play ravish Luciana Paluzzi , dock one fact be apparently cousin be never addressed.The film wind up lamely stage revolution whose surprise resolution will surprise no one , and final bit action Carlton-Browne that would seem nail lid his coffin literally . apparently live see day , but film same name be strictly DOA .
watch film few time and i can say be low budget rubbish and do nothave anything do real history fact . actor performance be very poor but be result limited acting possibility . anyone who watch film now probably think Hitler crazy skinny lunatic who running gun Chicago gangster . can only say there be much good film Hitler and Germany year and rise evil be very much average . can recommend German film downfall which can see brilliant performance Switzerland actor Bruno Ganz roll Adolf Hitler .

problem film be many , but will try mention most glaring and bothersome one . first , theme suggest number vignette Manhattan life , reality be everything , as usual movie and TV , be about something bizarre , usually sexual nature . story line be thin or nonexistent , and virtually scene , camera shot , line dialog , and express emotion be absolutely , and totally fake . finally reach point hour so mind numb garbage walk out ( something no uncommon recent year . ) would have guess fi9lm be direct wannabe auteur drop out 3rd rate film study program , but believe ( one time , pre-Amelia , talented)director Mira Nair take part disgusting travesty , so perhaps directorial talent America have descend masse cesspool .

movie start off strong , LL Cool J ( Deed ) undercover police officer , partner Sgt. Lazerov ( Dylan McDermott practice , possibly miscast bad guy ? ) commit robbery and murder . Deed refuse kill drug dealer , which set up conflict dirty cop conscience . other big name ( Freeman , spacey et al ) be well cast and movie show promise.The movie begin fall short as soon Justin Timberlake ( Pollack ) be introduce . give opportunity make good movie people will possibly see repeatedly , or one that teenage girl will go and see once Timberlake , would choose former . even talented actor have work hard their craft ; Timberlake be nottalented and amount hard work can save . would have think would put good show , give fact have be act talented year . everything do film be unconvincing.Just singer sell million record and sell out stadium , do notautomatically translate can act successfully feature film . even hardcore N'Sync fan will notbe able ignore obvious lack act talent.That aside there be few plot hole , such Pollack 's sudden sniper ability and deadly operation warehouse machinery . movie have so much promise . thoroughly disappointing .
This be absolutely terrible movie . do n't be lure Christopher Walken or Michael Ironside . be great actor , but must simply be their bad role history . even their great acting could notredeem movie 's ridiculous storyline . movie be early ninety US propaganda piece . most pathetic scene be when Columbian rebel be make their case revolution .

 Heavy-handed moralism . writer use character mouthpiece speak . predictable , plod plot point ( say five time fast ) . child 's imitation Britney Spears . film have all earmark Lifetime special reject.I honestly believe Jesus Nebot and Julia Montejo set out create thought-provoking , emotional film tough subject , explore idea thing be notalways black and white , one who be criminal definition be notnecessarily bad human be , and there can be extenuate circumstance , especially when put well-being child first . however , their earnestness end up be channel preachy dialogue and trite situation plant move plot along . decent production value and interesting use documentary-style camera footage be notenough accomplish their aim when script and act fall flat.Logic be often compromise sake create tension : Soid first try blackmail Pablo participate her documentary exchange help escape , then same breath basically tell nottrust be nothelp out altruism . well , duh . and man run , Pablo be far too sway temper tantrum . Cristina 's well-being be so important be flee capture and jail or deportation , but be willing risk all appease when do n't want go Mexico . right . talk over-permissive parent . third , when Pablo 's employer Charlie give phone Detective Bright , be remarkably unprofessional , especially give her seniority - do really think be persuasive ? oh , yeah , would have turn in . CCH Pounder 's Detective Wims could wipe floor her.To be fair , will like list thing like . Um , like midget . and like fact midget be name Sexy . there be cross-dressing , always plus ; juvenile cross-dressing , no less ! Harry be infinitely cut Cristina . but my favorite moment film have be when Cristina kick Detective Not-So-Bright . also find interesting , heavily minority cast ( which much appreciate , way ) , black character be racist one . too bad be just throw out there and notfurther explored.There be distinctive , unconventional score , but be nonetheless generally context-unspecific , notenhance mood or tension scene , pathetic , anguish wail time main character be anguish , as think his acting do n't show enough : ' just case be n't sure , be upset , and have musical cue prove it.'Stilted , clichd dialogue result depressing lack subtext ; everything have be spell out dialogue , even when body language have be up ' til then convey just fine . example , impassioned speech Pablo make , and Mrs. Knight 's lament her child wo n't be crawl bed morning.'Papi , tell Mama again ' - what shameless , blatant exposition introduce generic dead wife ! ( be always most beautiful woman widower have ever see , kind have ever meet . why ca n't see man cry woman Shakespeare 's - may be fat , ugly , obnoxious , but his love be deep ocean ? now _there's_ story which would move me.)The police always be literally one step give many scene out-of-place feeling French farce . most boring foot chase ever - Bright and Lightning be so out-of-shape and easily-fooled ( certainly be n't quick lightning , and , well , do n't feel need spell thing out ) . guy drag small child outrun bicycle cop , complete macho biker pick fight but then be fell child ? quote Margaret Cho , that be so sad . would ever see on ' Cops ' ? hackneyed and over-the-top deus ex machina : employer , would really waive check his green card just can quote author inspirational saying poster your desk ? plus several scene , include above , threaten devolve porn : ' well , will do favor , as long do something ... ' can almost hear bowm-chicka-bowm-bowm.When parent view footage shot Pablo 's remorse , grieve mom 's freak-out be most real movie feel . unfortunately , be diminish fact look completely sway his emotional speech right up go ballistic . more ambivalent look would be more convincing here.I be constant awe stupidity main character do thing sake plot : hold up convenience store mask , visit dead girl 's grave . and why do n't mother recognize his face when see drive off ? ! ' seem awfully familiar ... ' what be purpose wholly unnecessary , somewhat gratuitous scene Soid and artificially-enhanced bartender ? character development ? Tch . too little , too late.Speaking unnecessary trait that never go anywhere , Detective Lightning 's say skeptical Detective Bright must be Scorpio show how little really know occult . and do n't think believe fate quite qualify voodoo mumbo jumbo.At end , when Bright hold Pablo die - wait , why do care now ? her character be as inconsistent Soid 's . what , have shoot just say ' stop , or will shoot ' ? ( be care _so_much_ her integrity thus far . ) be unarm . there be need lethal force . what be wrong shoot leg immobilize ? finally , Cristina 's childlike acceptance her mother 's death give Dr. Knight peace his daughter 's death - so force . and contrivance family whose child be kill become Cristina 's new family ... anger could be ' replacement ' their little girl . be also unrealistic white couple would take Latino daughter man who kill their own daughter . be notsay there be n't generous , loving people who would do . be just say character here be never develop far enough believe _they_ would do that.I find offensive IMDb reviewer say course woman be move sappy scene . be woman who reserve my emotional movement moment that do n't wax sentimental manufacture manner.Co-writer , co-director , co-star Nebot say wear too many hat production . too many cook may spoil broth , but one cook alone just might end up make after-school special.In conclusion , film 's title have less do story and more do feeling regret , helplessness , and loss accompany revelation will never see your money again .
 Collusion Course be even bad typical " evil white male corporate capitalist " movie week . movie be less pleasant toothache . Jay Leno can act . be good his underrate debut movie , Silverbears , which give performance consist demand his character . movie be so bad Leno 's character , sanctimonious buffoon , be less annoy Morita 's character , sanctimonious fool .
movie be bill comedy and mystery . fail badly . only mystery here be why would anybody make such poorly construct movie . only comedy be laugh get when see how high reader here rank . could there be two movie same name ? movie see star girl pretty blue eye and plot that be n't there .
 Bought movie bargain bin Rogers Video store $2 . enjoy good B movie now and then and figure look good one.The movie be quite cliche " 1970 be " and be quite groovy . unfortunately story line be hard follow and notlot happen movie . fact , turn off watch 45 minute and figure week later should watch whole thing matter how slow was.The movie have good spot , but have wait and wait and wait ... ... .for them.If be B movie , might just be , just be warn movie be slow and notmuch really happen , and do mention notmuch story line either ...
I think be truly awful film--I find actually yell my tv couple time . or gay male lead be miscast ; there be absolutely chemistry and Richard Ruccolo look will rather be kiss dog . movie cover their long and tortured courtship , highlight break-up and make-up , but notdevelop reason in-between detail . reason would make interesting character , notfight or make-up scene bed ( lame even like movie).Andrea Martin and Adam Goldberg shine their character , but do n't make film worth rent . save your money .
turgid pace movie numb shock might provide . there be real suspense . most character be insipid . chesty Irish priest be as lame love interest . interest be mislead . girl choose provide film 's sensuality might be good . central conflict main character be uninvolving . film be entirely devoid positive . be tedious exercise someone who do n't want go gym day but do anyway .
film just go around circle , and viewer do notknow where be . first I thought..mmmmm , could be kinda cool movie , but just drag and , and eventually do n't know what be go on . lead female be good actress and play her role well , and psycho fella , be creepy , but bit do n't really care what happen , film just drag . shame really , could have turn out lot better.Would say though lead female and psycho fella , will have good career ahead , but will remember film , make know , or be film regret ever make .
 Memoirs Geisha be beautifully film movie , there be doubt . and acting be generally excellent , least term how portray character be scripted.However , so many detail small and large be just _wrong_ just bother too much be able enjoy fully . small detail that typify kind lack sensitivity sort be one scene ( no do notspoil anything ) where Mameha ring bell that hang door house where Sayuri live , snowy winter day . bell be ring be fuurin , or wind chime - that be only leave hang house Japan summer ! people traditional Japanese home do n't have doorbell - just open door and announce . ( may think be such trivial detail , but would equate movie make America where Christmas wreath be hang door July and one think anything . ) and do n't even get start totally wrong hairstyle give maiko and geisha , which be vaguely pan-Asian/Chinese/kung-fu-ish , and nothing real thing . think rather cavalier attitude culture be try portray really come out attitude and portrayal people and situation too.So , suppose less know about Japanese culture and world geisha and maiko Kyoto ( which be what " Miyako " be ) , then suppose more will enjoy . honestly think movie could have be so much good ... be , be just Hollywood version " exotic Japan " .
God , have n't watch movie awful long while . maybe not' New Guy ' or various Freddie Prinze Jr. movie . yes , be astoundingly awful . Mira Sorvino 's blank and wooden act surely must have be inspire Freddie . movie staging be awkward ( play , rather , and feeling confinement do notwork well film ) . actor have idea what be do , especially Sorvino . her accent be awful and her sex appeal non-existent here be painful see ' seduce ' other character and ' falling ' . and what be occaisional shot live audience lawn chair ? nonsensical ! have turn dvd player off , would have be self-inflicted pain finish film .
Why do constantly do ? mean , really , be right there title - " incredible melting man " . what else would expect ? have admit , be sucker just anything come across Monster HD channel , but only redeeming feature picture would be truly grotesque makeup job legendary Rick Baker . as creepy , will give nod horny old geezer couple suck lemon just light out . now be truly scary.Something could never figure out horror flick be why monster 's victim would n't simply just run away when face virtual annihilation . chick cabin . know , there be door completely visible right there kitchen could have run right out time . incredible Steve-O could n't muster much more brisk walk , so why notjust blow right ? do n't know , maybe be miss something.This flick have feel ' Tales crypt ' episode , but ' Tales ' usually have cool or grotesque twist which often time do n't see come . be one picture could n't quite get handle come OR go . example , early scene , can clearly make out Melting Man 's eyeball fall out his head , so how do manage get around rest story ? guess be notsuppose ask.At eighty four minute , picture be about hour and half too long . when be all over , be ready take up General Perry his early suggestion - " could really use drink about now " .
absolutely horrific film . Ameteurish and be n't funny . Lead character play Mehmet Ali Erbil be very annoy . edit E.T and star war be just plain stupid.Actor Yilmaz Goksal be only good think movie . should master his English and move Hollywood . Hollywood can notfind actor his quality . other Goksal movie be garbage.Director Gani Mujde be comic writer and movie be his bad write work date.Music Cem Karaca be plus waste money . actor Sumer Tilmac also have presence . actor who play three son have talent what so ever .
perhaps one bad teenage slasher film ever do see . will start bad point t movie , which pretty much cover entire film . first , something one can avoid : terrible acting . swear pick up random kid street base how look . secondly , BAD/UNCONVINCING CHARACTER WORK/DEVELOPMENT . hardly even know half kid who be kill here . all figure be deserve one way or . scarecrow 's character be overdo , and cheap rip-off other great fantasy killer such Freddy or Pinhead . next : bad dialog : Scarecrow be full horrid one-liner that would make laugh , only be so terrible . line " let be go find small animal torture ! " really just leave eyebrow raise . last but notleast : next off : bad casting . how old be guy who play Lester ? 30 ? back his head be balding God 's sake . there be much more could say film , 's cheap special effect , be " high school film class " effort , but point be understand . be just bad film make 's bad . as what find be " good " movie : -Entertaining low , low , low standard -Would help put insomniac sleep . -A very cheap laugh , or even giggle .
there be one line that make worth rent Angel fan . everyone else : be just very bad horror flick . female character be typical horror movie female . be wooden , annoy and dumb . be glad when be kill off . long live strong female character horror movie ! !
This must have be embarrassment member entirely African-American cast . derogatory , disparage stereotype black American community be feature prominently . wo n't reinforce insult list here , mention chicken , watermelon , and dice.One good song Ethel Waters ( and couple bad one ) , and fantastic singing and dancing talent 8-year-old Sammy Davis bring total up something 1 IMDb scale .

This fascinatingly awful movie . make so little sense start make kind weird internal logic its own . well , would do n't keep dart off side-alleys eventually flounder weight its own indecisiveness . movie ca n't make up its mind be straight forward ' Man Turns Monster ' flick ( all 1950s ' incredible insert verb Ing Man ' movie ) , or ghastly big business conspiracy theory movie , or mystical afterlife contact story , or ... or what ? take your pick . be just mess . grotesquely top and fire off direction , leave loose end flap place . be as Tobe Hooper have be take David Lynch pill . unfortunately do n't take enough .

terrible film which be suppose be independent one . need dependence something.This totally miserable film deal interaction Irish people . be try imitate wonderful film " crash ? " so , film crash entirely.There be just too much go here culminate little brat run around and throw rock bus and car which obviously cause mayhem.The film be just too choppy work . One woman lose her husband 14 year her young sister be rip off suitor . cause former sister become bitter vetch and walk around clothes notworth believe . old sister also become embitter but soon find romance.Then , have 3 loser who purchase mask rob bank . obviously , robbery go awry but there do n't seem be punishment crook . perhaps , punishment should have be writer failure create cohesive film .

expectation be somewhat high when go see movie , think Steve Carell could do wrong come off great movie Anchorman , 40 Year-Old Virgin , and Little Miss Sunshine . boy , be wrong.I will start what be right movie : certain point Steve Carell be allow be Steve Carell . there be handful moment film that make laugh , and be due almost entirely be give wiggle-room do his thing . be undoubtedly talented individual , and be shame sign what turn out be , my opinion , total train-wreck.With out way , will discuss what go horrifyingly wrong.The film begin Dan Burns , widower three girl who be be consider nationally syndicated advice column . prepare his girl family reunion , where his extended relative gather time other.The family be high list thing that make awful movie . family behave . be almost as have be transport Pleasantville or leave Beaver . be caricature what think family be when be 7 . reach point where become obnoxious and simply frustrating . touch football , crossword puzzle competition , family bowling , and talent show be notHow ACTUAL People BEHAVE . be almost sickening.Another big flaw be woman Carell be suppose be fall . observe her first scene Steve Carell be watch stroke victim try be rehabilitate . what imagine be suppose be unique and original woman come off mildly retarded.It make think movie be take place planet . leave theater wonder what just see . think further , do n't think be much .

Thats just notenough . know when see film would achieve good critic " philosophical , eastern and artistic " and whatever approach . but film be just totally mar .
This be most cliche ridden and bad romantic comedy have ever see . scene be cringe worthy and two lead actor - Corey and Danny be soo annoy . Corey be very dumb and naive and should have never listen Danny 's false promises.Neve Campbell and killer Urban Legend be only redeeming quality poor attempt film . Danny ( Dean Paras ) look his late thirty and girl be try bed - Corey look as be still college.Here Australia , film be call too smooth ; there be nothing smooth film . negative Avoid

" chase " , only two police car be use , both which be early 90 's Nissan Sunny 's . notonly would be rather cheap pick ( and find rather hard believe will be use such mundane old car South Africa year 2000 ) , but as far can remember , there be only 2 involve and none get scratch once . car chase be very badly shoot , distant and badly time camera angle and minimal traffic road , and be all over around 2 minute maximum be suppose believe very small kid be actually highly skilled driver who can easily evade police driving be pedestrian and utterly unexcite . now lead character and acting , which be equally bad . aforementioned kid who drive car , look about 13 year old and supposedly be extremely skilled lose incredibly inept police . everybody else be equally unconvincing , so much even look bore time themselves.At close scene movie , our main character ( " Sox Moraka " ) be ask gang leader steal car car park . have trouble open , Police arrive and ask what be do and reply tell be their car . brief argument try arrest and then hold police gunpoint and jump back their car . be , Police return fire and turn get wound . pathetic chase sequence , decide abandon car and set alight destroy evidence . what follow here be one most downright laughable and hideously awful special effect have ever see . when car " explode " , superimpose flame suddenly appear window awful sound effect that be n't even time . be so badly do and so phony look be hard even put word , and really need be see be believe . watch slow motion look even funny . have see good effect murder reconstruction documentary . car be Volkswagen Golf MK2 GTi . something that would n't be worth huge amount , and seriously could n't afford destroy real explosion ? will love know how large budget movie be . feel so cheap be surprised make outside South Africa , and even more surprise make DVD release.I know be notbig budget Hollywood production . know be mean depict gang impoverished township South Africa who steal car middle class and sell part black market , but laughable effect , poorly execute car chase , awful acting and ludicrous character , sense reality be completely lost.Overall , most certainly do notadvise watch . want have laugh and see most poorly do , low budget mess amovie ever create , then will recommend , and only that.It be wretched , poorly make , poorly edit , poorly pace and tedious piece low budget drivel that fail count . have see many South African movie , include lot cheap NuImage/Nu-World action picture , and their cheesiness , be far well count .

 Wow . think might be insipid but be even bad imagine ! sometimes like watch good " car-crash " movie : that be so bad ca n't look away want see how bad can possibly get . be really only reason could leave television - morbid fascination . be n't so much acting , which be only mediocre or slightly bad one would expect cast , but premise and plot which never should have see light day . script , too , be groan-inducing . as cinematography , do anyone else notice use " curtain draw " segue device , old 50 's TV show ... but irony ? first think must be kid but movie take too seriously have use tongue-in-cheek manner . do n't even ask score ... only high point be final song , Morcheeba . guess want leave people something their $8 ... glad see TV ! ! ! ! ! just silly ! wonder be why Timothy Hutton have have trouble find much work recently ? guess do n't expect much , and want watch mindless thriller , would be good spend evening clip your toenail , which be why merit 2 .
 Seriously , do n't even know where begin . be somebody give bazillion dollar budget autistic third-grader and say ' make movie secret service ' . edit be ridiculous , cinematography be random good , single syllable dialogue be completely retarded and directing ... well , be there even director there ? everything be just so pointless and lame and pointless ... and random ... .and lame.Here be spoiler ; movie be dumb thing will ever see.However , like piece , will also enjoy ; Deterrance , Dark Blue , and partial frontal lobotomy .
be 1974 and star Martin Sheen.That alone say what expect movie.And be movie . accord movie , Slovik have reform , get good woman , and do n't want fight.In real life , Slovik may have be naive innocent , or may have just want manipulate system.Whoever Slovik be or be n't be history decide , but be movie that deal dessertion time when country be question why be fight , and movie take sides.With regard serviceman who be Viet Nam either 1974 ( Willie Nelson would say , let be tell truth , be about Viet Nam war , notWWII ) , EoES be as propagandistic Gung Ho be forties.According movie , Slovik state his position , plain and simple . have nervous problem . heck , have clinical nervous condition , and trust , have do military duty , would have be problem either just let my nerve go and fail my task and get demotion or put KP duty or latrine duty problem.If believe teleflick , Slovik do n't have option , doubt his criminal history.Whatever viewer want believe be up viewer . have learn movie decade or decade , deal service or military duty , will pretty much take same stance and over.1940s and 1950s , serve your country.1960s and 1970s , mock your country.This be history.The whole movie seem predictably Hollywood . refuse serve and only when be be strap up be execute do show emotion.Such emotional outburst could have easily work his advantage his declaration his nervous condition , but obviously movie want show human being and only when be about die do become sorrowful.I be notCatholic , but think recital hail Mary Ned Beatty and Sheen end , Lord 's prayer , be funny sound be try see who could say faster.I do n't see how movie could be watch realize be aim Tricky Dick Nixon and Viet Nam war.I hope be all worth Slovik and anyone who choose follow his example .

do n't think have ever feel let down film before . loving Guy Ritchie 's two previous film ( do n't count Swept Away - be pussy blind ) , be so look forward see this.The review be poor , then again , do n't trust press anyway . more worry be fact Internet buzz be be bit stinker , so be trepidation hand over my 4.80 yesterday afternoon.I be noteven go try explain film , mainly have n't get clue what be go and one point be honestly close stand up and ask be just who do n't get ! unfortunately think Ritchie seem have fall his wife 's trap take far too seriously.It seem be n't good enough make film good plot , laugh , snappy dialogue and good character . be almost as have checklist film want rip off , here be one noticed:The Matrix , Fight Club , Kill Bill , Usual Suspects , Vanilla Sky ... think most frustrating thing be performance two main actor , Jason Statham and Ray Liotta , be actually very good and be really self indulgent story and edit / direction that let film down.So big , big thumb down .
feel Rancid Aluminium be complete waste two hour , plot line be thin and confusing , prestigious line up player have terrible dialogue and extremely questionable accent . camera work be somewhat experimental place and could be see what director be try convey , just make even more difficult watch . One most annoy aspect Rancid Aluminium be over use narration film almost entire plot be be dictate audience . good performance be n't anything do act . fact probably most convincing performance come Dani Behr people , admittedly do play stereotypical office secretary . do notcircumstance go and see movie need reason catch up lose sleep , there be certainly good way spend your hard earn cash .

what waste time and money ! my hubby and see movie - see preview and think " might be funny " . wrong ! movie be about 90 minute too long . actor be trap poorly write script and ca n't get out . joke be weak and tired , and noteven see Wilson 's naked behind can redeem part film . special effect ... ..are n't . half expect see harness and wire hold up Uma her fly scene . and when effect people apparently could notmaster superhero 's faster-than-a-speeding-bullet fly or fight scene , cover everything swirling vortex blur screen - which hide awful effect quite nicely . Wilson 's sidekick be lame excuse man and Wilson have chemistry Uma or his office co-worker . sex scene be n't sexy and funny scene be n't funny . guess just expect too much actor . none character be really sympathetic , so end up notcare fly fig . only memorable performance be kid who play Bedlam and G-Girl teenager - least THEY have chemistry . overall , super stinko movie - would n't even recommend rental - would still be waste money !
be important notbe insult lack logic or common sense and who have " gray matter " will agree movie just do n't work.The problem lie direction , cast selection and lack depth character building . word comedy be very hard thing say when i expect laugh when word be use . Let 's look problem direction/script.Brother and sister both their mid 30 be seem be well adjust . meet complete stranger park and Heather Graham character walk up and ask most intimate question that even sane person would be run other way or least scream police officer . then awkwardly walk and make stupid statement and fall . then ONE date be all go out together fall love and decide get married Vegas week 's time ? ? ? ? hello do anyone feel stupid yet ? go out thousand woman and meet one person who say about 10 word WE see screen and want marry . notonly be there chemistry just do n't make sense . sure be romantic comedy and want believe could , but direction make completely flat.Now Heather fall head heel her too and when Heather Graham and Bridget Moynahan ( very shallow character ) kiss or more point be sloppy kiss ever chemistry might be there . find unromantic and unfunny and many say Heather can act i think reality be Heather be clearly wrong person role.This be Sue Kramer debut director and be just too much chew . would take lot craft make movie work and IMHO could be do good writer and casting and direction .

 Seldom do give up movie see entire show . be particularly true when have rent DVD . Syriana be one which do give up . way turn off bored disgust.This movie be disjointed , boring , confusing and lackluster . act be dry and credible portrayal . general plot be good but develop such insipid and boring fashion fail grasp my attention or interest . multiple sub plot often fail connect other and seem more random story actual connected plot . too bad such serious subject and such great actor could create such flop . can imagine movie receive nomination much less award .
know movie will notgo well when John Carradine narrate ( a.k.a. read script & plot synopsis ) his character 's funeral procession , mere 5 minute movie . narration be his character 's last will & testament . stipulate his estate be divide his 4 child and servant . child shall split $136 million equally , but should die then share be split remainder . all child should die then be divide servant . be eligible , must live family estate week . sound typical plot reality show.There be little subtext as nature Dean . be powerful and severely dysfunctional family , but real trouble start drown dog . opening voice-over John Carradine expect movie will lead Machiavellian cat and mouse game twist ending.That journey be painfully slow and pointless . trudge minute watch people sit around , play pool , throw dart , misuse " fish bowl " shot , dramatic conversation silk cravat wear man , constant bickering , misplace circus music , bizarre flashback reminiscent faux-German expressionism , horror aesthetic 4th grade and heap dramatic overact . all inevitably lead expect & ungratifying end . will be happy still be alive , but pain might be too great bear alone . share child , share.-Celluloid Rehab

that be only way wo n't think film be total waste time and money . remake " Heaven can wait " , ( which be least worth watching ) be poor excuse romantic comedy . be more vehicle give Rock time film weak stand comedy which do n't play well big screen . especially his joke generally be suppose be body old , fat , rich , dead man but be show come Rock . insult Blacks and White chemistry be all wrong . movie be notfunny , poorly shoot acting be weak good . go rent " Heaven can wait " and live Rock video and will be way ahead game .
" film " be one most dreadful thing have ever seen.Please do favor and avoid incompetent concoction.Shaking camera and have your actor adopt scowl do notcount " direction " , which film need drove . notwriting be all wonderful , rather be leave bunch completely artificial character direct most artificial way ( pseudo-documentary " style " prize who do n't know how direct).This film give impression be do cynically appeal critic who do n't know first thing film-making ( which be most them).Just terrible . say lot Sundance and what be become Victor Vargas be showcase there .
` Matrix ' be exciting summer blockbuster that be visually fantastic but also curiously think provoke its ` Twilight Zone'-ish manner . general rule apply here- and sequel do n't match up its predecessor . bad , do n't even compare it.`Reloaded ' explode screen most un-professional fashion . opening few second first impression be generally good one Trinity be shoot dream . immediately , film nose-dive . disastrous first 45 minute , gradually gain momentum when enter Matrix and Agent Smith battle take place . but lose speed when reach 14-minute car chase sequence and get even bad big groan-worthy twist end . bad be overlong ` Zion Rave ' scene . notonly do have absolutely nothing do plot , but be also pathetic excuse porn and depressive dance music.The bullet-time aspect ` Matrix ' be good addition , but ` ' Reloaded ' overuse make seem boring . first one there be interesting plot turn , but here be too linear be remotely interesting . movie be basically , just series stylish diversion that prevent realise just how empty really be . work incorrect principle big be good . appear ` Matrix ' franchise have quickly descend special effect drench misfire other franchise such ` Star Wars ' saga have.The act standard be poor most part . good character course go Hugo Weaving 's ` Agent Smith'- only one be slightly interesting . Keanu Reeves be definitive Neo , but all special effect , there be little room make much impact . Academy Award Nominee Laurence Fishburne be reduce monotonous mentor poor dialogue . Carrie Ann Moss ' part action chick could have be do much well other actress.A poor , thrown-together movie , ` Matrix Reloaded ' be disappointment . who do n't first one be unlikely flock . one be die-hard fan only . even movie 's own sub-genre special effect bonanza ( Minority Report , Matrix etc. ) be still rather poor . my IMDb rating : 4.negative .
 Cheap and manipulative . film have heart.It be also get dire dialogue , unconvincing character and preposterous , or rather non-existent , story . just lurch bad bad cynical effort wrench kind emotion insincere and unengaging hysterion-afest ! and HEDGEHOG ! ! ! !How many cheap shot can film take ? hedgehog , way , give most convincing and watchable performance ninety-minute cringe-athon.If have consider watch film , do n't . be sorry but can find single redeeming feature movie . score big , fat Zero . strictly sub-Dogma knicker-wetters . Yawneroony ! still , like dancing Dark ...
one multitude slasher that appear early eighty , Pranks be notable only early performance Daphne Zuniga ( sure thing , Fly 2 ) ; her character die fairly early , and rest film be totally forgettable.During their Christmas break , group student volunteer clear condemn college building its furniture . crazy killer , however , throw spanner work methodically bump off youngster one one variety gruesome ways.Exploiting stalk ' n ' slash clich book , director Jeffrey Obrow deliver tedious and unexcite horror that have pray character be kill , so could get watch something more worthwhile . majority death ( which , let be face , be why generally watch kind film ) be brief and notgory ; only truly grisly imagery come right end when body victim be discover remain survivor ( there be one notably bloody dismember corpsethe film could have do more).At last minute , film save disgrace receive low possible score have nice unexpectedly downbeat ending , but really be one slasher completists only .
movie be good example extreme lack good writer and director Hollywood . fact people be pay make piece junk show there be lack original idea and talent entertainment business . idea audience pay see movie ( and idiot rent film ) be discourage also.Obsessed teacher ( 3 year prior ) kill teenager 's family want . reason kill mother , father and brother . first five minute see bad acting and direction . year later , obsessed teacher break out prison . HMM--usual bad writing--no one town terrorize know last minute . obsessed teacher somehow become Navy Seal and can sneak around , sniff out people and knife be super killer . sure ! ! ! now obsessed teacher kill hotel maid reason , knife bellhop fun , and start hunt down teenager 's friend . now there be perfect way get girl love . obsessed teacher sneak out hotel---again be stupid , ever cop would know his face--but walk right . now kill two cop outside teenager 's house and somehow sneak her bedroom and kill her boyfriend.There be notone single positive thing piece garbage . other profession put work low quality , would be fire . yet idiot be make hundred thousand dollar write and direct trash .
 Nut case be murder college student , can new teacher stop madness ? !Believe , wo n't care.With title Splatter University , would immediately gather movie just be n't high art . but bad Splatter University do n't even qualify amusing garbage . splatter U be so poorly make - story be mindless , character be throw-aways , and whole movie lack essence imagination . needless say there be suspense or atmosphere or scare . drivel be n't even brave enough throw nudity ( cheap thrill ) . so all endlessly flawed slasher offer nothing way entertainment ( noteven cheap laugh ) and just become complete bore . bottom barrel folk - even die hard slasher fan will want think twice view , let alone pay money flick.BOMB out ****

... .ripoff dozen good film . particularly Steven Martin 's " LA Story " , which least have grace be obviously fictional even star his then-girlfriend play his girlfriend film.Yes , naive boy and girl , " 20 Dates " be mockumentary , be notabsolutely certain that be Myles Berkowitz 's intent when start . my impression be start project semi-seriously , then quickly realize would be pathetic and notfunny make situation more and more ridiculous . result , whole thing have uneasy , cheap and insincere feeling it.As someone smartly point out , film have two " date " sue and put restraining order Myles and yet appear film , which would be impossible would require consent form . also appear majority woman who appear " date " be professional actress ( albiet notfamous one , except Tina Carrere ) -- be simply too obviously pretty , polished , thin and comfortable front camera be average civilians.Mr . Berkowitz make classic error only cast kind very pretty thin actress , instead utilize variety believable woman , which might have make premise ( even mockumentary ) more believable and funny . also skate over what be probably his real-world problem , and which be both movie character and real world Myles Berkowitz appear be functionally unemployed ( his real life IMDb credit be practically non-existent , except film ) . even world movie , his ex-wife divorce never be employ . think viewer ( let alone Mr. Berkowitz 's real life date ) be deserve explanation manage live one most expensive urban environment US , luxury apartment , drive fancy car and eat out pricey restaurant when do n't see have source income whatsoever . ( be drug dealer ? live off his rich parent ? clue ! )You can get away most anything film , joke be really funny . " 20 Dates " be painfully , embarrassingly UN-funny . Mr. Berkowitz 's idea joke be have his character , restaurant date , announce his companion how food serve be likely give diarrhea or constipation -- WORST kind childish potty humor.It be notvery surprising discover Mr. Berkowitz never make film " 20 Dates " and last 8 year , have notmake single film , appear actor anyone else 's film OR have write or produce credit kind . my gut instinct tell film be notfinance " Elie " ( gangster money man who appear off-camera ) but more likely Mr. Berkowitz 's affluent parent , or perhaps represent shocking abuse credit card . whichever be , can all rest easy be unlikely have see Myles Berkowitz or his creative effort EVER Again . hallelujah ! ! !

Inspite good start rapidly go down hill.Ultimately be horribly typical BBC effort , complete strong regional accent , whacky over-acting character , " be day " soundtrack , and lot " issue " attempt be worthy.I find cringe many point film . writing be predictable . possible cliche be drag out and air . fact , have trouble think cross-cultural/cross-generational device that could have be use that be n't . character be thin and cliched : eccentric non-conformist minister ; well mean but ultimately racist old woman ; weight , overbear aunt ; pushy Indian parent ; work class neighbour ; ' wise ' profound grandmother ; motorbike ride thug . script be weak , chance shock audience overt racist dialogue two dimentional racist white character take . and why have be set 70 be ( apart need excuse 70 's soundtrack ) be mystery . possibly make unbelievable character slightly more believable people bear 1979 . do n't know.Even thing aside , good acting could have carry respectable obscurity . instead , usual " BBC comedy " suspect be wheel out ham up .

acknowledge nice cinematography , can hardly say anything positive movie . single real issue be protagonist 's dilemma remain his childhood friend world misery or leave and take up his own life . abundant " emotionally powerful " scene do notgo plot and , bad acting , also fail create intended atmosphere . director only manage introduce Anthony 's dilemma and eventually bring easy solution . character do notseem evolve , be difficult speak character ... perhaps Sonny . , actor do notget play much and when have , come off self-indulging amateur . wonder what ruin movie more : superficial script , throw away all potential plot , or bad acting , disturb appeal that might be leave .

have say first watch film be about 6 year ago , and actually enjoy then . buy DVD recently , and second viewing wonder why like . act be awful , and as usual have stereo-typical clansman their fake costume . act be awful good . Tim Roth do OK job as do Liam Neeson , but have idea what Jessica Lange be thinking.The plot line be good , but execution be just poor . be tired see Scotland portray film . Braveheart be even worse though , which be film only save grace . but seriously , people do n't speak day , why do all actor have have Glaswegian accent ? just film try and capture essence already tired and annoy stereotype . notice only people here who say film be good be Americans , and be honest can see why will like , know have infatuation man Kilts . however , be think buy DVD , will say spend your money something else , good film .

movie have IMDB rating 8.1 expect much more . start out funny and endear energy that feel spontaneous . but movie be half-way through , begin drag and everything become sickingly predictable . character office be delightful first third movie , but get know little too well ; become caricature , notreal people . be same story have see hundred time , only tell here slightly different circumstance . thing be , could stomach predictable love story only dialog be n't so stale ! only thing that could be bad be character have inconsistent and unbelievable motivation , and unfortunately that be also case Dead Letter Office . hopefully movie will end up Dead Movie Office soon .
only sex have ever have be farm animal , then tag line movie be probably still misleading.This be far one most boring movie have have pleasure try and watch lately . find DVD lie around my friend 's house , and make sad mistake notburn it.I be unable tell detail spoil movie there be only about 5 detail movie . just try imagine someone make movie thing c-span only fictional movie be 10 time less interesting most boring debate c-span.I think there be conspiracy somewhere movie , but be unable tell exactly what be gouched my eyeball out and throw Richard Gere .
movie which Brooke Shields out-acts Fonda be go be both anomaly and horror . Shields actually be only bad be youthful , inexperienced , and clearly notwell direct her co-star . Peter Fonda be bad , well , be bad . like Ulee 's gold , year later , but Lord above , be awful here . notanyone else be good . there be notsingle performance ( Henry Fonda 's delightful cameo ) that be even passable . have never see movie many bad performance . case Luke Askew , chief villain , be clear be poor dialogue and direction , be do good work past . but his partner , play Ted Markland , be embarrassing ham . writing be just bloody awful , and actor can be fault terrible thing have say . but say so badly ! edit and direction be bad pedestrian . shot be hold way too long dramatic reason , or cut off impact scene can be realize . picture be far bad have imagine and would have be utterly forgotten ( and probably never even make ) participation couple famous name . One bright spot : cinematography Grand Canyon be exquisite , capture beauty area way even big-screen Imax production have notquite do so well . and finally : either be bad version Paper Moon , lovable pair father-daughter type , or be bad version Pretty Baby , considerably more icky romantic relationship forty-something and 13-year-old . suggest more latter former , and thus be pretty disturbing .
be search Hollywood video last night friend try find good-looking horror movie watch New Year 's weekend . be look shelf , " Severed " spot my eye , and grab off shelf and look might be decent B-grade horror movie . cover look fairly good . plot sound semi-interesting . so rent . what mistake . do n't be fool cover , which actually look decent . be think more money be spend cover artwork movie . film follow two police detective who be track down voodoo-inspired , ritualistic serial killer call " Head Hunter " , who be decapitate victim leave and right unnamed city ( probably Los Angeles ) , and become draw his world ritualize murder.Story sound somewhat good ? well , be , and movie could have be halfway decent . but good God , be bad ! almost everything be laughable . opening scene feature redheaded actress car try talk huge , outdated cell phone , and whatever reason , go and talk guy . then , shadow come up , hack off his head , and girl drop ground and start crawl ( absolutely reason ) try dial 911 . sound ridiculous ? Yep , bet be . entire movie look be film VHS-quality camera , and be assume be . act be mostly awful , and special effect be far believable . and scene policeman phone be awful - voice other line be echo and sound be be record someone 's bathroom . everything movie be simply amateurish and tedious , and do n't hold my interest very long , and often find bored and tired , mostly bad acting and horrible cinematography . pace be bad . everything be just bad.Overall , " Severed " be failed attempt what could have be decent B-movie . plot be good and think film have be handle well and have high budget , could have be alright . but movie fall flat 's face . be expect something semi-decent , will be sorely disappoint . only recommend can tolerate D-grade horror flick . otherwise , will probably want stay away straight-to-video garbage . have little potential , but be mess . negative .

Burt Reynolds come point his career where appear just be go motion . will show up , party his friend film , and take home big paycheck . do n't seem matter product be represent be pure crap.No film epitomize more " Stroker Ace " which make " Cannonball Run " look classic and " Cannonball Run II " look watchable . save few race scene there be absolutely NOTHING worth see here . even beautiful Loni Anderson ham up so bad dumb blonde be embarrassing.If thought Burt ham up Jim Nabors and dress chicken sound funny then be your movie . otherwise pick almost other film comedy and wo n't be any bad .
dislike Frosty return and one . both film be absurd poorly write character and bad voice . voice could have be do but Frosty return be worst unalike snowman draw . frosty be winterwonder land be great and so be original heartwarming Drama . only good thing film be Frosty snowman be alike classic 60s and funny line when be talk thing that be notreal and then Frosty walk window hum , whistling whatever be do but everything else be badly write and badly animate and barely get plot . see DVD cover library 2 or 3 year ago and art look crappy do n't pick up year picture back look little touching but play film . be hassle poorly art character just DVD and be just terrible what be go on . watch night and find dull fall asleep whole thing ( wait always do when watch something go sleep ) but movie be overall boringOverall rating : grade -CThis be holiday special bad rip-off frosty return and one . one be badly 4th sequel Home alone 4 well i think movie be OK but home alone 3 be great . but be bad home alone 3 and 4 people hate . my sister do n't watch much when come my room watch 2 minute and half , walk away like " hate animation ! " agree just like 3rd one Frosty return . plain awful !
The act film be really well do honestly , but movie be so slow and so boring , as soon get interesting everything slow major halt . be glad see Sam Rockwell , do great job , so do other actor mention but man ... be one bad drag film have ever see . now maybe short film form movie would be good , but other , avoid . film have so much filler make Twinkie cake jealous.I never , ever , walk out film , but watch one home family , walk out . yeah , be boring . apparently my comment do n't have enough line post , so here be more filler . guess be inspire movie just watch .

love Henry James book and Washington Square be exception . be very excite see new movie come out , base book title . Jennifer Jason Lee be exceptional actress and Ben Chaplin good enough play lead role . Albert Finney be miscast and do n't carry role well . want shoot Maggie Smith ... .or rather her silly , insipid role . real problem and what be lack late version be good script , music , and direction.I fall asleep theater watch long , draw out and exceptionally boring movie . there be more pause dialog Pinter Play . book feel deep caring Catherine Sloper and her life . movie have just opposite effect . also dislike twist where her aunt have sexual attraction Morris . Eeeeeeeek . YUK.Watch ca n't sleep , be definite snoozer . do n't watch be depress . will need Zoloft this.Sure , " Heiress " be exceptional Olivia Haviland and Montgomery Clift title role . actor who play her father be mark uncare , cold father ... .still grieve his dead wife and hate Catherine . movie be notfaithful book but be one.This movie be box office flop . have doubt why .
boring stuff get here . his 5 minute short be good . know why ? there only 5 minute and not91 minute or how ever long is.The plot be kinda ... eh. . last half hour be alright rest be boring and notfunny =( have my hope up , trailer make look funny but pace movie be pretty slow and sadly notfunny . just plain boring klaymen run other and try make laugh. . notworking.Maybe next time knox.Maybe re-cutting movie and add good scene would do lot healing but now its just notgood .
Normally be notmotivate write review . but movie be so excruciatingly painful feel must . cringe appallingly predictable plot , lame acting and laugh moment which be suppose be tense . indeed most audience seem pretty bored and chatty even " most tense " moment movie . Molly Ringwald stand out only performance merit tortured production . even " twist " end be n't . have hear say movie do n't take seriously ; but could find little evidence movie.Cut should have be leave cut room floor . do favour and spend your time and money something else !
usually do n't comment anything ( i read other opinion ) ... but , one I _have_ comment ... be convinced do watch movie world action , F-117 and other hi-tech stuff , but only few first minute and change my mind ... Lousy acting , lousy script and big science fiction.It be one bad movie have ever see ... Simply ... do n't bother ... and one more thing , movie usually check user comment and rating site ... 3.7 point and give movie try , now be wonder who rate movie give more 2 point ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
watch film be big fan River Phoenix and Joaquin Phoenix . think would give their sister try , Rain Phoenix . regret check out . be embarrasing and film just have weird plot thats what want call . Sissy be just weird and Jellybean just sit toilet who sleep old man mountain , whats go ? have never be so unsatisfied my life . be just total rubbish . ca n't believe actor agree do such waste film , money , time and space . have Sissy being ' beautiful ' didnt get . think be everything but . thumb be just stupid , and why do care can hitchhike ? WHATS THE Point ? ? ? 0 out 10 , shame poll doesnt have 0 , doesnt even deserve 1 . hopefully , Rain be good other film , forgive one performance , mean wouldnt do much good film .
Steven Seagal ... .how could be part such awful film ? rent movie your movie usually have be pretty clean . have lose lot respect be awful movie such one . very , very poor taste ! be embarrass even rent movie . Steven , keep act movie one , believe your career be over . my husband and have enjoy watch many your movie always can " get bad guy " few hand maneuver and make clean ... and also language be pretty clean your movie ... but one be something else . will think twice rend movie .
progression plot be enough " rope one " and create curiosity outcome . however , ultimately , feeling that remain be producer movie forget end . intention be create perpetual circle ( occasionally do Twilight Zone ) , be too sloppy view positive effort .
not very good movie but accord info be pretty accurate depict torture technique . purpose film be show brutality NK POW camp and that be do effectively enough , surprising frankness time . whatever technical flaw exist ( and there be plenty ) watch will see forgotten corner forgotten war and pretty nasty stuff - again , nasty be be do north DMZ and notGuantanamo Bay.I do n't think Korean veteran bring up his torture when run office , and watch movie one and Pork Chop Hill comparison Vietnam film . do n't know be people in ' @card@ be trap WWII concept ( boy tend wisecrack lot ) or war or what , but be interesting see same system 16 year later would be make movie " go tell Spartan " .
Sly Stallone be hardly fine actor world but compare his brother , Frank ... well , roll out award now ! mullet haired , Muppet Frank seem think part play , call do role American/Italian wise-guy refugee the ' Godfather . ' Please , somebody make acting offer ' can refuse ! ' film just stink place out , even terrible overact , Frank still steal act dishonour . all people compensate their lack talent shout their line and throw their arm about , gesticulate wildly style that go out fashion back silent films.The plot , what there , be , make sense meteor land and turn all woman sex-crazed nymphet but be 15 certificate film , that just mean strip their underwear and make moan sound dog heat . what happen end , be notquite sure be lose will live long film finished.Avoid plague and watch ' deep impact ' reasonable film meteor about hit earth.N.B . point order : when one female lead strip down her underwear , have her knickers/panties her suspenders/garter belt , be knickers suspender allow woman go toilet less fuss . trivial point , perhaps , but show how dumb film be when ca n't even get right !
there be great film be make Steve Biko . sadly be n't . Denzel Washington - never most flexible actor - be totally unable convey great charisma Biko have . Attenborough 's big crowd scene be laughable . Soweto massacre be n't , three neat line child ( do cartwheel ! ) march happily gun soldier . Biko dead film rapidly descend farce . struggle Apartheid be anything be black people 's struggle yet somehow be all suppose be grip escape white man and his family . be sure Donald Woods be decent man and would be first say Biko be important be n't . Penelope Wilton 's accent be pure Hampshire and seem completely unaware be South Africa . . Wood 's family dog get more line black maid . family make their escape woman see film - incidentally one only dozen black people large , full cinema - whisper " be sound music . " have point.Overall be film well-intentioned somewhat inept white liberal radical black people 's struggle . and really South Africa need well-intentioned white liberal need hole head .
like see animal be skin alive , their head smash , dog throat be crush my man stomp , then one be ! but be somewhat normal , and do n't need see real footage animal cruelty , pass one up . movie try shock viewer , and sure does.With animal snuff beginning , and killing baby movie ( fake least)its be enough make turn off.I have see movie show slaughterhouse footage ( BTK movie ) and kind footage should notbe allow horror movie.We watch gore and horror know its just make-up , and special effect , so should n't sit down watch movie and see real killing animal , its notwhat rent movie for.If anything , there should be large warning label put type garbage movie people win ; t be surprise . very hardcore horror fan , one turn my stomach . entire movie cast and crew need their head check .
 Terrible film Frank Sinatra Tony Rome . here , get involve dead woman sea.Rome be soon hire find out what happen woman . naturally , be woman sea . her room mate , Lainie Kazan , soon wind up dead floor.An age Richard Conte play police officer and friend Rome . when local club owner get kill , blame fall Rome and there become interesting chase scene . be how bad picture be have depend chase scene supply action.Raquel Welch play beauty up her neck intrigue . her acting lead lot be desired.Martin Gabel be retired hoodlum whose son be try outdo him.By film 's end , do n't know why girl be murder . do n't even bother ask .
Film start 3 people meet other bar . OK . be talk their imaginary life , lie all time , reason . still OK.From time time , even make laugh . interesting . first 30 minute actually enjoy ! but then ... thing become bad ... nothing be happen ... long time ... and then , when something happen , all can see be naked old " lady " touch other ! notOK . disgusting ! way , part should be top movie , but be everything ! movie have point,it 's boring , and sick ! strange thing be here(Belgrade , Serbia ) FEST ( film festival ) , movie be most popular accord research , course , people watch ! even thought(before watch ) : " Hay , might be interesting , be Russian movie " ! but , God , no ! ! ! !
what disgrace ! be check out hope would be undiscovered James Garner gem and what stinker turn out be ! production quality be fine , but plot be undeniably lame and can honestly say be only couple hour old and lot dumb now . movie really have redeeming quality and kind stuff keep come out , will give Hallmark bad name . who insist know what be about , be about nothing , and case , be notgood thing . be subject watch one old ornery woman who be one dumb creature ever roam earth , who happen be marry real sweetheart who be probably only person alive that could put up . drag one mess , get one embarrassing situation , and be proud whole time . then movie end . what relief that be ! notworth time would take watch , so do favor and skip one , will be glad do know how bad one really be .
first 20 minute , cliche possible be trot out hack writer and director . there be NTSB primary investigator tortured family life ; politically-tortured NTSB board member play by [ can kill ANY TV ] Ted McGinley ; tortured father crash victim ; and torture sleazy ambulance-chasing lawyer.Hollywood still have concept fragility aircraft . crash plane be 737 and be mostly sit ground hippo who decide take nap . first third fuselage be intact , rear half plane be intact and debris field show wing or engine . most people should have walk away light how many people survive plane that get shredded Iowa lose its hydraulics . most TV plane be n't even burned.It remind scene " Air Force One " where 747 hit water and then skip along be make inch-thick steel.The show be so bad be impossible watch . even my wife , who be more accept , be comment technical flaw . what have stun be how POS could ever get make . be producer thing so use clichs ca n't even recognize ? somebody read script and say : yes , want spend million buck make real . wish be guy 's next appointment . have title wonderful bridge New York will sell cheap .
This be absolutely bad piece crap have ever have watch - actually be so bad just Had watch :-)The CGI be sooo bad be fun ! be noteven close shitty CGI animation Spawn , that be how bad be , har har har ... be amaze fact distribution company actually have put money down release DVD , but guess will get more money out that way , ' cos cost make can nothave be more few hundred dollars.It be so awful kindergarten class could have make it.See and laugh !
do notrecommend movie , be inaccurate and mislead , story be suppose be Algerian Berber territory , one be shoot southern Tunisian desert , ( completetly different culture , know be Tunisia and Algeria ) , other shocking element be character her companion aunt , speak movie very eloquent French , university level academic French character play be suppose be disturbed never leave her mountain kind personage , so live Bedouin kind education i context be impossible , most disgraceful scene and disrespectful especially people region be " femme repudiee " segment which be s pure invention writer/director , thing like will never happen Algerian Society ever ! ! !
 Positively awful George Sanders vehicle where go be thief police czar.While Sanders be excellent character actor , be certainly lead man and film prove it.It be absolutely stupidity . Gene Lockhart do provide comic relief moment anger lead fire his gun tragedy resulting.Sadly , George Sanders and co-star Carol Landis committed suicide real life . make film deplorable , be notshocking.The usual appealing Signe Hasso be really nothing here .
see Arthur(the TV series and books)years ago and never be fond show very much(if be fan cartoon,sorry be spoil you,but be actually what think).Lots people like it,but didn't.The school kid character seem fight all time(especially Arther and DW),they be nice other frequently,but gradually get tired Arthur 's complain attitude everyone and his sister DW(however name be spelled),and DW be ADHD(or ADD)-like 4-year-old sister Arthur who be sometimes demanding(which could be why Arthur get annoyed what her routine were,like her imaginary friend and her stuffed animal collection etc.),Arthur 's friend act teenager instead what be like Arthur books,and parents,well,they do n't care very much.The greatest cartoon be Rocko 's Modern Life,not Arthur(no offense ) .
can barely find word express how utterly utterly awful film be . be sell promise action , Segal and stealth aircraft , which normally make entertaining action movie . can honestly say will rather gouge my eye out cocktail stick have see film again . act be so awful be almost funny . story be insanely weak , plot hole so cavernously wide could fly F117 . script be so poor , find out 10 year old write should n't be least surprised . direction and production be so amateur , would n't even hire people shoot my bad enemy wed video . Utter Utter drivel . responsible make movie have cheapen art , and should be ashamed . Steven Segal should never ever show his face public again , ca n't imagine what make agree star , bad film have see my entire life .
Leon be cute SNL , be only minute . most SNL skits-to-movies , one ca n't fill 90 minute . have cute moment ( one have see trailer ) but actor be largely waste . Tim Meadows do his good but plot just do n't have many high point . Will Farrell have bit part . Farrell may be funny man alive ... but notmovie . what shame .
@card@ 's " Exorcist II : Heretic " do no favor , be hard imagine what Thespian extraordinaire Richard Burton see drab exercise non-thrills . have see all before : Burton play writer who discover early age possess power move inanimate object force his mind ( and think " Carrie " have impact Hollywood ! ) . though adapt novel Peter Van Greenaway , " Medusa " play recycled good , special effect cathedral finale be solid ( typical ) . Lee Remick be somewhat present doctor , but otherwise support cast be extremely weak . Burton be hammy but weary ... noteven telekinesis could save point . *1/2 ****
remember name Kevin Lime - and please , please never lethim direct again . timing , pace , edit : hopelessly wrong.Three or four decent professional ( next time , guy , walk off theset ) can do nothing save film amateur AliceEvans , and kind production standard will expect fromteen-produced child 's show British TV.Greatest mystery : music . score so inept , inappropriate andill-matched tone film seriously wonder isa case sabotage . add acoustic boom apparentlyunengineered single mike , and director who onlyintermittently remember add auditory action offscreen , and wehave what must be great ratio money result ofrecent year .
wealthy widower Anthony Steffen ( Alan Cunningham ) be sadomasochistic lover , and British Lord . bring sexy red-haired woman his castle , where whip and murder . Black-booted stripper Erika Blanc ( Susie ) get away , temporarily . Mr. Steffen be haunt wife " Evelyn " , who die childbirth . therapy , decide marry again , meet pretty blonde Marina Malfatti ( Gladys ) . end movie , will have have dig few more grave . " Night Evelyn Came Out Grave " be great title , least.** La notte che Evelyn usc dalla tomba ( 1971 ) Emilio Miraglia ~ Anthony Steffen , Marina Malfatti , Erika Blanc
why would legitimate actor have read script participate piece crap ? my god be actually embarrassing even watch . ca n't imagine shame people must feel be part . also , there be apparently controversy River Phoenix have cameo movie . be uncredited but his list role here ( IMDB ) do give credit . BTW ... Rain be his sister who have be ask before . film be proof matter how many big " name " have . Sow 's ear do n't make silk purse . love Lorraine Bracco but be just sad , sad , sad ... maybe somebody someday can explain reason kind film . have endear , entertaining , or even comedic property comparison 's bad everything else .
OK i be most people , give free ticket and i will go and see most thing , now multiplex cinema be so good ( i remember old " flea pit " single screen cinema and i be healthy side 40 ) . England film be release " Liar " , be dog . be total waste good celluloid . negative photograpy and set only .
 Sadly,this be not' well British gore film hellraiser ' , DVD cover claim , which be what trick buy . be , however , homage many great horror old , film most notably Amicus stable.Cradle ... be shoot mini dv , which all know have more TV feel movie , can be do so much well . scene , set and shoot look have be light exactly same way ( standard key , fill , rear setup ) , which only enhance cheap look finished piece . gore content be , quite frankly , laughable . open shot where see man be obviously foam rubber head tear apart , tacky cheap prop hammer , creature effect and terrible cg , there be nothing there impress all.The acting be abominable , near-comatose detective brummie dwarf , Dani Filth , least convincing horror movie bad guy have ever witness . substories be more formulaic last , and set get bad and bad movie run . look out ' Mental Asylum ' - Georgian semi detach house bad cg sign outside , and most bizarre ( and notgood way ) pad cell have seen.It take four attempt get end film my attention wander ( nay , run ) away available opportunity . actually find dust one point film be running.It do , however , mark one last know appearance Emily Booth 's breast , which guess be one ( um , two ) thing have going . once be out way though , be downhill.I have hear people say good thing Alex Chandon , and would love believe , but evidence be notlikely . want decent homage Amicus , avoid and go League Gentlemen Christmas special instead.Currently battle out Blair Witch 2 : book Shadows title bad film have ever see .
hate movie . be horrid movie . Sean Young 's character be completely unsympathetic . her performance be wooden good . storyline be completely predictable , and completely uninteresting . would never recommend film anyone . be one bad movie have ever have misfortune see .
This be one bad movie have see long time . story be boring , dialogue be atrocious and act hammy . be notsure movie be result film school homework project , but certainly play one . be noteven particularly successful its central conceit try appear single continuous take . whoosh horizontal camera pan be cheap and unoriginal way hide cut .
... ... film be pretty awful , only thing stop give rating 1 be fact unfortunately have see worse.The jungle music , juttering demon , and fluorescent UV style blood/teeth/eyes give " awful " look , and script be dire ... ..this film be more test see how long can last give up . be also predictable but notgood way . nothing film do be good way . watch 10 minute ago and think would rant bit so there be . ( oh and acting do n't let film down , be also terrible )
movie be notfaint or weak heart . could n't decide be go be porn or legit . be neither one . be just bad . there be nothing movie make want see anything else make people again .
there be spoiler here ... there be plot spoil . Madchen Amick be live proof face can make living act -- talent require . only bright spot be few really good one-liner deliver very nicely Alice Krige , but then again , be Alice Krige . her soft dreamy voice give only hint just how seductively dangerous odd creature can be . be believably creepy otherwise unbelievable plot . how get agree project remain mystery . screenplay writer must have be medicate when submit script . have major continuity problem , superficial stereotypical character , horror formula writing , and simply fall short make sense what-so-ever . creature , have neat skill go " dim " , question where come and what be be never so much explored.Do n't waste time one .
hodge-podge adapt Gore Vidal novel ( actually one great American writer ) make Magic Christian and Valley DOLLS look Fellini art-works . Raquel Welch , incredible body ( and be actually notvery tall ) lead role ( Kansas City BOMBER when be quite good ) play Rex Reed 's ( bad movie reviewer ; notcritic ) alter-ego , only be surround drag queen ( great chick ) Mae West , horny John Huston , young and " naive " Farrah Fawcett ( pre-Lee Majors ; what shame ) , and other various creep-azoids pretend spoof way too may thing have nothing go inter-spliced old film clips ( i.e. Widmark Kiss Death , Lena Horne ) ... Just can continue bleed life out everyone.A 2 10 . good performance = ? . be so bad , be worth see !
be try decide jump wood chopper would be more enjoyable dreck . finish destruction what be once classic couple film . Jedi , Menace , Clowns and Sith have death Lucas ' career . want swallow Annakin be Vader nonsense ? never believe be true . film vindicate feeling . story have n't work Phantom Moron , and new film just pile crap that be leave be toy parade . have go . know where new rock throw be . want spoiler ? here come . Luke and Leia be notrelate . Vader be nottheir Father . Duke Countoo should have switch side still could . Yoda have less verbal skill Yogi Berra . his advice have never be any good anybody . Obi Wan lie Luke first two film . Annakin do n't build C3P0 . find desert and lie his Mom put together scratch . Chewbacca have flea . whole mess Vader and fall Republic can be blame stupid b***h Amma-Lamma-Ding-Dong . have brain would n't have come light year Annie , but have tell do what George Lucas write . what dope !
... ... horror movie that be . alright first off , let start Kate . her main goal include get lay George Clooney , look good and last but notleast screw everyone over . Gotta love . have about 3 amazingly good chance finish off sicko but ... . . instead run . mean do n't wanna bring Guy out 10 minute and when do be too late . mean guy try rape . cant get movie where main character be sad idiot . mean who honestly would have sympathy guy who finish off everyone have meet night . movie keep go . and result lose all its credibility .
' Baptist Our Barbecue ' be good film ever make . now , get your attention horribly inaccurate statement that should be hang offense speak , let begin my short overview tacky , offensive , pretentious and boring hunk junk guess could consider movie . first , low budget stinker be totally obvious base very poor and inexperienced direction Christian Vuissa , and tacky , overly preachy , whiny and stilted screenplay F. Mathew Smith . really despise fact send very pro-Mormon , and sort anti-every other religion message . yes , story be about small town half full Mormon and full Baptist . show all main and role-model character be Mormon , and be so nice and perfect , yet be be pick evil , connive and very judgmental Baptist . show how beautiful Mormon be and how cold-hearted and ignorant Baptist be , instead show little solidarity would be appropriate and realistic . be part religion ( be actually atheist ) , but offend , along countless amount Baptist most likely . show Baptist be very unopened and unwelcoming Mormon , and Mormon be very accept , when again , reality there be mutual like/dislike . sorry , do n't mean go off rant.Another aspect ' Baptist Our Barbecue ' do n't much care , be acting . performance be very amateurish and unnatural , especially female lead Heather Beers . Miss Beers stumble her way her part passion or feeling her role , and be n't too much impress Dan Merkley , who be main character lackluster motion picture , but have say be way more talented or show more talent film then Heather Beers . whoever play town sheriff be awful also . there be maybe tiny laugh deep film , be full clichs . example , main character , Tartan ( Merkley ) , find solace Native American who always give good advice thing relate tribal way life - how clich be that ? make situation even more pathetic clich , Tartan buy poor , lonely heathen puppy dog . Ugghhh ! want my advice , stay as far away ' Baptist Our Barbecue ' can . see shelf and think would be cute and interesting little indie religion . all get be , well , piece crap . grade : D-my rating guide - A+ ( absolutley flawless ) ; ( masterpiece , near-perfect ) ; A- ( excellent ) ; B+ ( great ) ; B ( very good ) ; B- ( good ) ; C+ ( mixed bag ) ; C ( average ) ; C- ( disappointing ) ; D+ ( bad ) ; D ( very bad ) ; D- ( absolutley horrendous ) ; F ( notone redeeming quality hunk Hollywood feces ) .
be force watch whole series film young child and be tell be real ! talk child abuse . would have be less frighten Dracula or Frankenstein . series be only good people who believe ridiculousness and who want indoctrinate their child believe same . obvious issue associate brainwashing and indoctrination , there be also bad acting , bad writing , and Bad " special effect " . be just around terrible , terrible movie . yes , believable ( and horrify ) kid , but ca n't imagine grown-up buying shlock . , must say , would be interested see today , adult . might have certain midnight/cult movie feel .
never want see film , then one day , joke watch see how bad be ; my preconception be confirmed.For starter will like question politics film . hide behind mask woman ' make big city ' but only way woman can make big be through use their sexuality rather their intelligence or skill . woman be nothing more whore . be slightly less attractive girl notallow be successful ? be notonly right wing message film , there be hundred shot American flag and huge wad cash . fine example how only powerful thing America be capitalism and anything spiritual , moral or artistic value be noteven give look film . money be depict only important thing young people.The manageress bar state do notallow drug user her bar , and then go on poor gallon hard liquor her own neck and then neck her staff and customer . one who know anything intoxicant will know liquor can be just as dangerous heroin and more dangerous most illegal drugs.And finally , why be scene which lead character be point sexual interest audience ( when be get undressed or her boyfriend ) be her father always involve ? watch get undress camera virtually caress her leg be one phone her father . she ' auction ' her father just ' auction ' her boyfriend . find most strange.In conclusion , film be immoral , fascistic , degrade woman and frankly , disturbing . but what else do expect Jerry Bruckhiemer ?
when hear Dukes Hazzard be go be remake current actor and solid script , be like , " alright , will give chance , be notgo be good first , but will see what happen . " well , see what happen . see great late 70's/80 's show that be classic , basically humiliate Hollywood . be so sad see Hollywood scriptwriter can come up something original day . be seem take great show that have great target audience , and try " REMAKE " classic show . head Hollywood ... Ai N'T WORKIN ! ! ! ! anyway , more show . think could have casted good actor Sean William Scott ( Stiffler American Pie ) play Bo . be sure John Schneider be definitely disappointed how his character be portray and take advantage . also , get real , Johnny Knoxville , Luke Duke . how low can go ? ? crappy jackass actor play lovable Luke . sicken . also , will give Jessica Simpson be beautiful woman , but her acting suck . Catherine Bach who play original Daisy , be smart , sexy , strong , opinionated and good IL ' southern girl . be little girl role model grow up ! ( own doll and jeep - thank very much ! ! ! ) Anyway , Jessica Simpson play smart ass , 2-bit slut Daisy Duke . Daisy never be blonde . why do have cast . Jessica Alba would have play great Daisy Duke . can speak great southern accent , and be gorgeous , and would have do wonderful job . anyway , will like say movie blow something fierce . feel get rip off pay $8.50 ticket , and should refund my money . Dukes Hazzard ( original series ) do n't see movie . will just upset . CMT ( country music television ) play rerun Dukes all time later night . so set your TIVO 's and go real thing , notimitation big screen Hollywood .

" story " be stupid be sum up and really everything film suck . please , pay special attention " sheriff " . guy be adult and therefor have absolutely no excuse be involve . be extremely bad well . whatever do have hilarious moment . check out , haha
TV production 2000 's start be weak and bad . mark ( Alias , Lost , Prison Break , Desperate Housewives , or Monk ) TV do n't have right hit yet , which could capture attention and interest 2000s ' viewer . title ( Relic Hunter ) , ( Mutant X ) , ( Lost World ) , ( Sheena ) , or even ( Baywatch Hawaii ) be n't encourage watch and follow , or least be n't captivate and interest all time what precede .

( be special unit 1 ) . but even accord brilliant formula ; do n't work well . be promise ; time there be saturation out " supernatural " case decade many X file already , natural spirit lampoon naughtily too ( imagine Mulder womanizer ! ) . however ( special Unit 2 ) be n't strong , or strong when come make comic Sci-Fi show . be highly ridiculous , where instance sexy situation must turn ugly disgusting one . enjoy bad taste sickeningly . ( Michael Landes ) be non-charismatic and mostly unbearable comedian . his chemistry ( Alexondra Lee ) , as well suppose sexual attention , be all languid . sure show get funny look but overall be unfunny work . be clear there be nothing more interesting its main idea . ( Evan Katz) 's other work co-writer and co-producer ( Seven day ) or ( @card@ ) later must be low point ! . distinctive personality , manage be silly jest most time . therefore be there goal , so make one silly indeed ! and truly , would be one rare time be thankful cancellation show 19 episode only !

 ***Possible Plot Spoilers***I adore Dennis Hopper . question why accept role police detective 2000 be Spreading Ground . movie flat out suck and be about tell why.This be about small town which be about get contract sport arena . One hitch : there be killer loose and that be bad business . Mayor make deal Irish Mob find killer and make sure never make court . Det . Ed Delongpre have other plan . want guy catch too , but be level and believe system . want see system do 's job.That could have be pretty good . could have be riveting . be horrible . first , label guy serial Killer . err no . there be specific criterion and none fit here . bad guy have kill 5 kid first day , and think be 2 second day . entire movie span 48 hour time period ... . hardly serial Killer action . do n't care what warp motive give end , serial Killers do their deed long time span . do notjust all sudden kill 7 kid two day . be Spree.Ok irritant aside , act be atrocious . only name here be Hopper , and be only one who come even close pull off his part . unfortunately , be kinda type-cast and think do psycho part much , much good . just be n't good vehicle Hopper . do n't allow do what do good , which be act creepy . be notdo bad , be have see do so much better.The Irish Mob guy , Johnny Gault ( Tom McCamus - Long Day 's Journey Into Night ) , who be charge their investigation be just top stiff . contradiction ? notreally . be try play cold , hard kinda guy and do point character be just wooden . bore max . do n't scare . do n't inspire emotion boredom . can tell how many time check see how much longer be til end movie.The other thing be have feel made-for-TV movie . know what mean . poor production value , low budget , re-use scene save cost . just eh . Yanno ? but , feel compare be insult those.Derek Vanlint be both Director and Cinematographer project . bite off more could chew . ca n't help feel Hopper must have take role personal favor friend . be only rational can come up . be Vanlint 's first job Director , third cinematographer . hopefully be learn experience him.I wo n't ruin ending case do decide torture one , but do want say all drop ball here ... even Hopper . scene that should have be emotionally gut-wrenching detective , be just..well. . blah . do n't see angst that would accompany total gear-change guy make . very disappointing.This 100 grueling minute long and rate R violence and language . kid 13 be go have interest whatsoever watch , so worry there . be notsuitable anyone anyway . heh.Skip one . will thank later .
** here Be SPOILERS **The government have continue develop UniversalSoldier program , now call UniSol . soldier be now strong and be able take more damage before . however government be downsize , project endanger and supercomputer that be middle feel threaten , so take step ensure his own safety . activate and control UniSols and start run mayhem . only one who can stop be Deveraux ( Van Damme).This movie be about one thing . choreograph fighting . story be bad , and be soon drown fight . whatever happen , and wherever go , fight . unfortunately movie , be fun watch fight where know one part be indestructible . normally be pretty sure hero will win , but still want feel fight be two somewhat equal combatant . notwhere be indestructible and ca n't lose . then fight just become tool stretch time . wait final fight when Deveraux miraculously find way beat his unbeatable foe . further lower my opinion , desperate and sure sign bad movie be how much scantily clad woman there be . well , there be n't really lot , character be most man ( there be least one woman UniSol though ) , but almost woman be needlessly show least just bra once . female lead get , but also pass strip-club ( use computer no less ) much more undressed woman . moment do notgive anything story and be just there try please adolescent-minded male audience.So , conclusion , boring fight . more , no less . well , maybe less ... negative
Charlotte 's deadly beauty and lethal kick make movie cool will be otherwise.The story be so poor and Charlotte 's character die such foolish way , that wonder be end have think movie . wish somebody could tell alternative ending exist , but fear do n't . as rest cst , well will say simply do n't act very well ; blame should be put poor script.This movie remind Rush Hour 2 where Zhang Ziyi die absurd way , have be only one who have steal show whole movie . could give movie 2/5
make up movie-going audience - be certainly stun number positive comment wretched film have garner here . ca n't credit , ca n't help but be suspicious , matter , back alley payoff critic who be tout Annette Bening Oscar ; hole kitchen ceiling might be more appropriately attribute her scenery chew . be wonderful actress but be unfortunately unbalanced performance , lack essential quality film actor must master catch cadence screenplay and maintain duration disjointed madness that be film shoot.I do n't really want blame Miss Bening or most other performer ( well , Gwyneth Paltrow have excuse her muzzy work ) , however , be horrendous adaptation , classic case mistranslation ( be prepare assume . have n't read book and do n't think will ) . script launch middle/muddle unaccountable behaviour and extreme emotional angst spew mystify character who have develop relationship neither nor other . quickly become grotesquely excessive tsunami-like assault that sully character and audience alike and leave survivor shake my head detritus leave end repetitive episode . shock and awe would describe my reaction frantic , bi-polar mood swing rant and oh-so-quiet sensitivity , latter telegraph one most irritate , manipulative , drone soundtrack have hear - that be , when all be n't be set ludicrously incongruous toon - period stuff , ya know , but choose astound disregard tone scenes.How fine cast get mix up do n't know - ca n't believe see screenplay signing . certainly apply their skill commitment - feel so sorry wonderful Jill Clayburgh saddle cartoon bag lady costume and wig try vainly wrench something significance sketchy and clichd dialogue . contrast , somehow , Alec Baldwin rise material deliver consistent , nuanced , real performance . can somebody give man lead role substance , please ? and how about Rachel Evan Wood - or Joseph Fiennes ? will think industry could make good use , and appear as hirsute Elliot Gould M.A.S.H.My vote ? standup turd , right , but link heaven .
read first 5 review IMDb be very enthusiastic movie . but be really awful movie , total time see alien be about 5 minute ( rest movie be cheap suspense ) , acting be top story , oh boy , which story ? story do n't seem go direction , first capture alien ( 7 year ! finally succeed ) , then do n't know what do ( 7 year ? ) and even want release ( why hell do capture ? ) . then girlfriend , who be act be most top , want walk away madness , then suddenly do n't , then again , do and then do n't . then come conclusion kill alien will kill whole human race ( and remember , all year other human have see permanently settle alien ) and what do do ? torture and blow bunch alien peaces.This be my first review IMDb , be very lazy person who do n't write very soon , so listen my warning : move be notworth your time , do n't watch movie .
only thing great movie be its title . case , " Snake Plane " be example notjudge book its cover , title say nothing movie . when go theater , be n't expect Citizen Kane , be expect Independence Day , movie that be pure popcorn fun , but instead , get horrible Roy Liotta movie call " Turbulence " Yes , be how bad Soap be . only thing make Soap well be its title . and be noteven apporiate title movie , be n't even glimpse " snake " or " plane " 40 minute movie ! what false advertising ! be n't its title , Soap would be just unforgettable cheap B-grade summer movie . and R rating ? have be most undeserved R rate movie time ! maker movie only add few f word make R , violence be keep pg-13 level . know what be really R rate ? R rate superstar edge ! see Summerslam instead waste your money snake !
just 15 minute film , begin miss Zhang Yimou 's early , more weighty film that look politics and society China unique perspective . his turn martial art film be serious misstep my humble opinion . hero be his bad film Operation Cougar , needlessly complex story and act more wooden that find John Agar film . Shi Mian Mai Fu be no different . American who have be study Chinese film few year now ( and understand and can speak Mandarin ) , be sure my opinion be different many other be come different background . SMMF , Hero , be notreally traditional kung fu film , and be certainly notwuxia pian film . there be sword & sorcery or chivalry element here . be completely different vehicle infinitely more watchable film such Chinese Ghost Story ( all 3 ) , Butterfly Murders , Green Snake , et al. all feature charismatic lead who look be actually enjoy what do , SMMF feature bland , and sometimes laughable , dialogue combine cardboard acting . Zhang Ziyi play blind person about as well Ben Affleck . there be air superiority film that be really quite insulting . take so seriously , just become huge joke end . all actor look as be most important piece celluloid history , destroy chance actually convey emotion , and complete humorlessness really make wonder Zhang Yimou be make film per se , or simply showcase ( i.e. " ego booster " ) Zhang Ziyi . camera be literally make out her face and get sexually assault notonce but twice film . her act range really have n't extend her ability play naive " w"itch . be so concentrate her acting , come across cold and lifeless , as be read her line notecard . be so funny hear American critic and film people ( completely clueless Quentin Tarantino ) call film masterpiece . guess see bunch Asian actor screen look really important fly bamboo forest , be trick think 's brilliant film-making . Ching Siu Tung 's choreography , still retain his trademark style , edit , and posture , lack vitality and originality his early film Chinese Ghost Story , Dragon Inn , and Duel death . sadly say , wirework film be really subpar , and there be subpar/obvious wirework , then probably should n't have film high speed . same go special effect which have distinct B-movie feel . bean , dagger , bowl , arrow , sword , and other random object fly air ( be throw ) regard logic , turn , climb , and bank as there be little pilot inside . know logic do n't really hold place stylize Chinese martial art film , but do n't want induce mass amount giggle your audience , then should probably work your compositing bit more . mass melodrama , unintentionally funny dramatic moment , bore fight scene , really uninspired plot twist be what await Shi Mian Mai Fu . be obvious Zhang Yimou be no longer make movie Chinese audience . be mean crack Western market just CTHD do . watch Hero and SMMF , have come conclusion Zhang Yimou want make Hollywood film , be definitely off right start . SMMF be basically Phantom Menace Chinese martial art film . and think Hero be bad .
essential part British pop culture Monty Python and James Bond , Doctor who be massive hit 26 year ( 1963-1989 ) , make one long run TV show world ( most serial be lucky have ten season ) . plan reboot series be always BBC 's agenda , and miscalculate ( notmention Americanize ) TV movie produce Fox fail capture magic original version , nine year ( Comic Relief spoof and animated mini-sery notwithstanding ) be require ultimate Time Lord could return properly , courtesy acclaimed writer Russell T.

" . get more and more curious " man " , soon find whole new world : alien , invasion , travel time and space , and course , omnipresent Police Box-shaped TARDIS.The first 45 minute new Doctor who be almost perfect ( special effect could have use bit more polishing ) Davies nail two thing : show 's unique humor and two protagonist . original series ' most endear trait be its blend spectacular sci-fi and pure British comedy , hybrid that be hard , notimpossible , export . here laugh be all link conversation Rose and Doctor , who come off as fully round character just one episode . okay , so technically Eccleston 's Doctor be Ninth use name , but distance previous eight incarnation speak northern accent ( one use daily basis ) and justify terrific line : " lot planet have North ! " .The real triumph episode , though , be Piper 's performance : theory , Rose be her late teen , therefore nearly same age thousand young viewer who have never hear Doctor before . her portrayal ordinary girl lose new , exciting universe , represent new generation 's reaction return TV icon , and chemistry that instantly form and Eccleston be sign indicate new Doctor who be just as good old one.First , fifth , ninth , make difference : there may have be other Eccleston ( and Piper , matter ) but together , William Hartnell , Peter Davison and rest bunch be one single character , so cool do n't even need name : be Doctor .

 Coming shortly imposition morality code darken spirit writer , director and actor , first film adaptation W. Somerset Maugham 's " Human Bondage " titillate countless moviegoer . have shock value today , just fine acting.While cast be excellent , be Bette Davis 's first great role and one Leslie Howard 's good performance . Howard be English wannabe Parisian artist Philip Carey who be gently and firmly tell lack talent and his dedication be substitute true genius . take lesson heart return London and enroll medical college ( one , way , that seem have female students-at time there would have be least few . perhaps author/physician Maugham do n't care distaff medicos).Having tea one day Carey be entrance waitress , Mildred Rogers , Bette Davis role morally loose and basically wicked farrago . her Cockney accent be as sharp Eliza Doolittle 's . his repeated attempt date be greet less enthusiastic reply , " do n't mind , " sure sign man his head screw straight be plumb depth . Maugham 's Mildred supplement her waitress tip bit old fashion street-walking , something notclearly bring here.Carey 's besotted prostration serve Rogers ' avaricious need support financial kind . be desperately love her-she play Sunday church organist effortlessly ply her instrument . sex here . recognize be get nowhere , begin chaste relationship Norah , woman who adore . re-enter Mildred , replete baby , and her usual need be take care . exit heartbroken Norah.Another separation Mildred and Carey begin long-term friendship Sally , abet enthusiastically her dad who seem view eventual marriage both good thing two young people and chance be relieve one his nine offspring.The movie reasonably but notentirely follow Maugham 's excellent novel . Howard 's Carey be naive and vulnerable and much movie his sad eye remind one doe face double-barreled shotgun . Mildred be unrestrainedly wicked , user bad kind , her sole preoccupation her own need barely disguise when try wheedle Carey thin patina affectionate word ( and offers-at one point promise will do " anything [ ] want , " daring statement time and one be sure audience fully understood.Pre-Code may be but Mildred 's quick-march dissolution would have satisfy League Catholic Decency . ending be conventional-sin lose , principled behavior triumphs.Director John Cromwell wrought excellent performance his two main star , one well-established , other establish largely film . atmosphere be 1930s London and trip back time be worth taking.Available DVD.positive ( Davis 's and Howard 's performance )

starter have always be fan Batman cartoon theme be so universal , ' everyone alive have alter-ego ' . be true Mystery Batwoman . overall story be good be disappoint have n't really do much franchise this.Throughout movie , be try find out who identity batwoman be , unfortunately can find out easily look cast credit post website ( so have n't see already do n't go there ) . be sort disappointed do n't make movie longer . 75 minute be way too short movie . secret identity batwoman also come far too early movie , sort midway , and become anti-climatic afterward know good guy will always win and new character know Batwoman will disappear movie be over.I be also nottoo sure new animation style use movie . love sleek new character but there should be more detail where detail be call . part animation look so awkward and rigid grab your attention right away divert your attention away storyline . also do n't really bright atmosphere use most scene , sort lose its dark and Gothic feel which be Batman . similarly should have get know more batwoman 's personality so can build same deep compassionate feeling do Bruce Wayne . also think fight Bane should have be do well . typical child 's fashion bad guy meet his demise too easily either trip , fall , get electricuted or do something dumb that work . come think there be n't even one drop blood spill movie either.Bottom line , its good entertaining flick and recommend anyone who be Batman fan watch . have good storyline , universal appeal and even great act top off . just wish could have deliver more permanent change story make Batwoman stay make thing more interesting . notjust introduce and then kick off be do . will also like see someone else figure mystery change finally . have other Batman solve mystery and fill later details.I hope there be more animate movie come and look forward time when will actually be able see breakup Bruce Wayne and Barbra Gordan . have be string forever and do n't even and ca n't believe be dumb enough fall love someone 20 year old . also want see time when Tim Drake leave be get sick old man . short want see thing that lead character where will be Batman Beyond . otherwise same repeated formula will just end fast just decide move story .

reason why say be write screenplay and know very little be make be ask see film . write producer who sell tell . Alan Dobie be friend mine , get hear . have only write first draft be understandably worry when hear be floor . ask Peter Collinson , my agent , might like do draft . also ask could see my original script have lose . be tell , too late . so do only thing could do circumstance and take my name off . have idea what might have do my screenplay . then be invite see finished film . be so impress very quickly ask have my name put back . be beautifully make piece , hurriedly write first draft , expect be ask do much more work ; perhaps have would n't be so good . would love see my original script again anybody know where be ? would also love see film again , only see once little viewing theatre Soho .

( B-movies could tread where A-movies be forbid enter ! ) and plot be intriguing . regard Franchot Tone , however , beg disagree : , be suitably mysterious ; just right shade creepy . must bear mind there be sort German expressionism happening here ( director , Robert Siodmark , be German who come Hollywood war ) , and so air exaggeration fit whole film . least do me.However , be gorgeous Ella Raines who , only her third credit performance , hold viewer entrance film . " Girl Friday " type strong resemblance Gene Tierney , be wonder do n't become household name . but be so good here have just order film ( ' impact ' ) Internet , and ca n't wait see as well .
do n't really know what expect when go out watch film , apart slightly surreal basic plotline lonely man order Russian bride Internet . and have Nicole Kidman . absolutely love film though , and come out think ' wow'.Refreshingly down earth , film move along nicely , few suprises corner . relationship film be believeable , Nicole and Chaplin work other beautifully . humour be subtle , great ' Office'-like scene bank , and thriller element add tension be Hollywood.Overall film be about real people unusual situation . be less heroics and more delicate relationship . Brit-filmmaking its good ... ( positive )
 Simply well Estonian film have ever see , be make Finnish director Ilkka Jrvi-Laturi . Tallin Pimeduses be entertaining thriller bunch gangster who be try steal huge amount gold , national treasure that belong republic Estonia . but same time be kind summary condition many eastern European country time . early 90s Soviet Union fall piece and many country , such Estonia , become independent . now condition may be good most country . but beginning 90s many new nation have fight corruption and organized crime Soviet era have leave inheritance . ( and many still do ... least level ... )Tallinn Pimeduses be very realistic film era believable character and well-write script . actor be also very good , especially Jri Jrvet ( perhaps well known Estonian actor , play Snaut Tarkovski 's Solaris ) , playing and old gangster who be slowly become tired his way life . but most astonishing performance come Monika Mger , child-actor play Terje , boyish girl her early teen , whose presence plot be quite essential . ( and her name be noteven mention IMDb-credit list ! ! ! )wThere be notmany film world that manage be entertainment and artistic same time . but Tallinn Pimeduses do .

Frances Dee be one most beautiful screen ingenue . be obviously be groom stardom role that prove be notjust pretty face ( " Silver Cord " and " Blood Money " ) but when marry Joel McCrea her career start peter out . her Sally do notpush her talent limit . apparently Leslie Howard be notvery helpful Bette Davis set - be annoy English actress be notgive part . use throw her line " read book camera " . do start take interest when newspaper report " kid be run away picture " ! ! ! highly , Highly Recommended .

Gary Merrill make very interesting villain , his natural warmth provide nice contrast Andrew ' coolness ; his smile , amiable-seeming bad guy seem be continually challenge his nemesis mere fact his be emotionally open , as oppose tightly wind and moralistic cop who be pursue him.There be no major surprise film , which seem transitional concerned . director Preminger be reunion sort his Laura star , Andrew and Tierney , who be pass their career peak time movie be make . support cast,--Merrill , Karl Malden , Neville Brand--are , understandably , more optimistic , be their way up . Preminger , as serene observer ever , let event unfold express strong point view , morally ambiguous ending be somewhat disappointing , cat and mouse game two antagonist seem large and more archetypal mere movie could contain , much less resolve .

Orked be such ordinary girl depict more male behavior will see movie , defend Mukhsin much violent encounter her school-bullies , throw one bully 's bag out school bus window , throw punch and kick Mukhsin 's brother where tease Mukhsin and so on and so forth . be awesome buddy , and stick close , but slight misunderstanding which most would all respond same way , part both day when Mukhsin leave town.Now movie depict first love Orked and Mukhsin , start out friend , but slowly evolve somewhat more close relationship and then BGR . would notice , change Yasmin make movie main actor and actress when go love . different character be portray eagerness and mild humor . scene be all random but depict so much reality will be stick screen long time . will love movie what be , and notwant be patriotic local scene , coz mean much more.As movie envelope two love bird , also manage find its lens Orked 's parent , mother who be educate England , speak very good English and which , her husband and caretaker house very much attempt try speak back their own kind English , which be humor all way indeed . let just explain why humor can be such prominent thing movie . and explanation or description may portray can be give only one word and be randomness . often more not, do n't learn laugh , and when do , do expense other . be just what movie just Follow Law Jack Neo would have mention - often when be , do n't see person be , but when only when be person 's body , then only would learn see who really be . and be how humor apply as well , more so just dignity.The movie be fill such randomness typical fact our routine life carry out could be all way fill laughter want be.The other focus movie be how Orked 's neighbor , couple which husband be no longer loving his wife , and want find . Pak Koboi what be nick be see polish his motorbike daily and would take out ride his newly find girlfriend . producer do notfail show perhaps why husband want find wife . wife be real hurler or KPC Chinese would call , have interrupt other people 's business and send her own daughter tease Orked word only adult would use . , what go around , come around , and be probably why bad thing kinda want happen . time , be nice people wo n't hurt , have ego protect , but then again , what be worth ? movie also center Mukhsin 's brother , Hussein who would go out town everyday very late night , smoking , drinking , and also find ' girl ' . be total opposite Mukhsin , but be all perhaps family problem . both brother be stay their aunt and parent be far away . will notreveal more story line would spoil much interest want find out , but slight element which producer want send message viewer be life all . want , least view life our own perspective when be not. movie way , take out our own body , place character 's position , and use our empty mind then view happening . depend type and genre movie , will be mesmerize how good movie such would portray and imply significant impact .

Tony Hawk Underground come point where series be really start lose its luster , Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 do notlive up expectation and leave series really up air what Neversoft and Activision could do series that would be different and interesting.Underground introduce storymode , which be very cool make whole new world Tony Hawk Pro Skater fan . feature introduce which fan pretty much argue and be be able get off skateboard , which be nice now can actually climb , run , and do sort new things.The level be good , Neversoft also improve issue that start Pro Skater 3 and be length level design . first two game PS1 , N64 and Dreamcast be great level be nice and long and hidden feature . pro Skater 3 and 4 be shorten handful feature that be add and really push system too their limit . version , shorten feature , there be n't many people wonder street , fact there be almost none level , and graphics and skating physic be tone down little but notlot.This game do have one con , storymode be little short , course be Neversofts first time do Tony Hawk Pro Skater , that be understandable . however , being say will definitely finish game day.Overall , great addition that be very refresh .
Karen ( Sarah Michelle Gellar ) , exchange student Japan who be just begin do social work , be send aid elderly semi-catatonic woman , Emma ( Grace Zabriskie ) , her previous caretaker , Yoko ( Yoko Maki ) , disappear . Karen soon learn something be notright Emma 's home , and attempt " see how deep rabbit hole goes".Maybe be delayed influence success M. Night Shyamalan 's film , but slower-paced , understate horror film be recent trend . case , such Hide and Seek ( 2005 ) , approach work remarkably well , and other , such White Noise ( 2005 ) , pace tend kill film . do n't Grudge quite as much Hide and Seek , but be still very good film--it earn 9 out 10 me.The Grudge have couple significant difference other recent example trend , however . One , be well know be remake base Japanese film series that begin Ju-On ( @card@ ) ( particular , be extremely close first half Ju-On : Grudge , aka Ju-On 3 , 2003 ) . Two , as many Japanese horror film , slow pace here be n't so much realm realist drama surrealism . as be also case large percentage European horror , Grudge should be look more film nightmare.Director Takashi Shimizu , also director five Japanese entry Ju-On series date ( fifth be currently production ) , and writer Stephen Susco have largely dispense linearity and be notoverly concern logic or plot hole when come horror story . idea instead be present dreamlike sequence scene , dream logic , where focus be atmosphere , creepiness , uncanny , and many viewers--scares . how well film work will largely depend how well can adapt , or be use , different approach film-making ( admittedly , seeming gap be fill previous entry Ju-On series ) . traditionally , American audience consider flaw leave plot thread hang and abandon " rule " " monster " . more poetic , metaphorical , surreal approach film be n't yet accept mainstream U.S.However , even be notuse , be worth try suspend your normal preconception film and give Grudge shot . be well write , well direct , well act film , fill unusual property , such story interweave large number " main character " ( which be do well here more episodic Ju-On 3 ) , good cinematography , subtle production design touch ( check Gellar 's clothes , which match color and texture exterior Emma 's house , when Gellar first approach ) , and beautifully effective horror material.Even be more slowly pace your average horror film past , pace usually enhance eeriness , and there be shortage bizarre event keep horror fan entertain . supernatural premise film be absorb , and base interview DVD Shimizu , have prod pay more attention Japanese belief and folklore . most interesting subtext would probably arise more intimate knowledge Japanese culture , be interesting ponder why so many Japanese horror film feature scary child and adult who look scary children.I subtract one point film slightly veer clichd mystery/thriller territory " here be what really happen " flashback , but even that be fairly well do , and otherwise , would have be 10 out 10.Now have say all above , let finish mini-rant : be notbe anti-remake , but be ridiculous U.S. distributor and studio feel need remake foreign film make appropriate consumption . original version film should just be play U.S. theater wide release . there be need present almost identical film but just substitute white American actor non-white or foreign actor . yes , Grudge be fine film , but ultimately , will rather see something original use talent , and be treat late foreign horror films--not just Japanese , but also Indian , Spanish , Chinese , etc.--at my multiplex . hope someone pull studio read , be also more cost-effective do , as ( 1 ) can completely avoid production cost , and simply make domestic distribution deal which receive profit , and ( 2 ) can make money off fan who otherwise pick up foreign film DVDs foreign manufacture or even bootleg version .

apart have long reign British history ( 63 year ) , Queen Victoria also hold two other distinction . be , apart our current Queen , old ever British monarch , live age 81 . and be also young ever British ( as oppose English or Scottish ) monarch , come throne girl eighteen . and yet whenever television or cinema make programme or film , seem far more interested old Victoria do young girl ; version Victoria which modern audience will probably be most familiar be Judi Dench " Mrs Brown " . " Young Victoria " try redress balance show event surround her accession and early year her reign . have rare distinction be produce former Royal , Sarah Duchess York , whose daughter Princess Beatrice make brief appearance extra.There be three main strand plot . first concern intrigue Victoria 's mother , Duchess Kent , highly unpopular figure even her own daughter , largely influence her adviser Sir John Conroy , who be widely rumour be her lover . ( accord one unfounded rumour , and notlate Duke Kent , be Victoria 's natural father ) . second strand concern grow romance Victoria and her German cousin Prince Albert , and attempt King Leopold Belgium , who be uncle , influence romance . ( Leopold 's hope be increase prestige House Saxe-Coburg , which and Albert belong ) . third concern one strange episode British political history , Bedchamber Crisis 1839 , when supporter Tory Party ( which have traditionally support strong monarchy ) riot young Queen be perceive favour Whig Party and their leader Lord Melbourne , even Whig have historically support quasi-republican system government , monarch reduce figurehead.Scriptwriter Julian Fellowes be know his Conservative view , and time wonder may have colour his treatment political theme , seem lean side Tories , predecessor modern Conservative party . their leader Robert Peel be show statesmanlike and dignified , Melbourne , all his dash and charm , be show devious and uninterested social reform . there may be truth be characterisation , but Fellowes gloss fact only few year earlier Tories have oppose Reform Act , which end corrupt electoral system rotten borough , and have benefit William IV 's unconstitutional dismissal Whig administration.Lessons dynastic and constitutional history do notalways transfer well cinema screen , and one contain its share inaccuracy . Prince Albert , example , be notinjure Edward Oxford 's attempt Victoria 's life , and Melbourne ( his late fifty time Victoria 's accession ) be notas youthful be portray here Paul Bettany . King William IV certainly dislike Duchess Kent ( who be his sister-in-law ) , but doubt would have go so far as bawl abuse state banquet , be show do here . also fail understand significance scene which Duchess and Conroy try force Victoria sign " Regency order " ; Duchess 's constitutional position be make clear Regency Act 1830 , which provide would become Regent her daughter be still eighteen time her accession . piece paper sign Victoria could have alter provision Act.There be also occasional infelicity . one early scene see Victoria and Albert play chess compare pawn be move chessboard , metaphor so hackney whole scene should have come complete " Danger ! major clich ahead ! " warning . yet spite scene , come enjoy film . there be good performance , especially Miranda Richardson scheming Duchess and Mark Strong obnoxious Conroy . be visually very attractive , be shoot sumptuous style have come associate British historical drama . Jim Broadbent give amusing turn King William , do occasionally succumb temptation go top . ( notas disastrously top be " Moulin Rouge").The main reason film 's success , however , be performance Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend two young lover Victoria and Albert . Blunt be probably more attractive Victoria be real life , but her delightful portrayal Queen be long old lady popular imagination , black-clad Widow Windsor who be perpetually notamuse , but determined , strong-minded and loving young woman . her love Albert , and their happy family life together , be one main reason why monarchy succeed reestablish affection British people . ( exception George III , Victoria 's Hanoverian ancestor have be notoriously lack matrimonial virtue ) . Blunt and Friend make " Young Victoria " touching romance and gripping human drama as well exploration key period British history . positive

Peters give remarkable performance tough New Yawk cookie , part gangster moll and part damsel distress . when violence occur , genuinely care her well being , and be typical Fuller 's renegade , ahead-of-his-time style happy ending be notnecessarily foregone conclusion.But ultimate success " Pickup South Street " rest squarely world-weary shoulder Thelma Ritter , who play Moe , feisty lady who make money way can , that be sell necktie or act police informant .

 Iphigenia , Mikhali Cacoyannis be perhaps first film director have successfully bring feel ancient Greek theatre screen . his own screenplay , adaptation Euripides ' tragedy , be far easy , compare other two film trilogy direct . story have be very carefully deconstruct Euripides ' version and place logical , strictly chronological framework , well conform modern method cinematic story-telling . Cacoyannis also add character his film that do notappear Euripides ' tragedy : Odysseus , Calchas , and army . be do order make Euripides ' point regard war , Church , and government clearer . finally , Cacoyannis ' Iphigenia ending be somewhat ambiguous when compare Euripides'.The film be shoot location Aulis . director photography , Giorgos Arvanitis , show rugged but beautiful Greece , where Homeric day time seem have stand still . take advantage body , arid land , ruin , intense light and darkness . harshness landscape be particularly fitting soul character . camera use whole gamut available shot , very long , reinforce vastness and desolation landscape , as well human scale involve , extreme close-up , dissect and probe deep soul torment character . particular , film 's opening , bold , accelerate track shot line beach boat , follow aerial view many thousand soldier lie listlessly beach , be very effective mean communicate Agamemnon 's awesome political and military responsibility.No word but " sublime " can describe stunning performance Costa Kazakos ( Agamemnon ) , Irene Papas ( Clytemnestra ) , and Tatiana Papamoschou ( Iphigenia ) . Kazakos and Papas embody sublimity classical Greece tragedy . Kazakos ' character be extremely down-to-earth , and his powerful look camera , more his word , reveal unbelievable torment tear his soul . Irene Papas be modern quintessence classic Greek play . Iphigenia , be terrible her anguish , and even more so what know will be her vengeance . Tatiana Papamoskou , her first role screen , be outstanding portray innocent Iphigenia , which contrast Kazakos ' austere depiction her father , Agamemnon.Cacoyannis be faithful Euripides his representation other character : Odysseus be sly , scheming politician , Achilles , vain , narcissistic warrior , Menalaus be self center , obsess his honor , eager be avenge , and have his wife and property restored.The costume and set be realistic : Hollywood there . Agamemnon 's quarter resemble barn , dress , as do other , utilitarian , hand-woven , simple garb . Clytemnestra 's royal caravan be make up rough-hew wooden carts.The music be prolific contemporary music composer Mikis Theodorakis . Theodorakis ' score intensify dramatic and cinematographic unfold , reflect psychological aspect tragedy , and accentuate its dimension and actuality.This film and story narrate offer considerable insight lose world ancient Greek thought that be crucible so much our modern civilization . teach much individual and as social and political creature . Euripides question value war and patriotism when measure simple virtue family and love , and reflect woman 's vulnerable position world manly violence . his adaptation Euripides ' tragedy , Cacoyannis revisit theme modern , clear , and dramatic fashion.The relationship govern political machination be clearly demonstrate : war corrupt and destroy human soul such extent neither individual nor group can function normally longer . possible exception Menelaus , whose honor have be tarnish his own wife 's elopement her lover , everyone else have his own private motivation go war Troy , which have nothing do Helen : thirst power ( Agamemnon ) , greed ( army , Odysseus ) , or glory ( Achilles ) . and so real sense , Helen become WMD Trojan War . war , strip Homeric glamor and religious sanction , be just imperialist venture , spur primarily desire material gain , else be convenient pretext.Another conflict raise film be Church and State . Calchas , who represent church , feel challenge his priestly authority and wish destroy Agamemnon insult goddess serve , tell sacrifice his daughter . consent sacrifice , King come closer his moral undoing , but refusing , lose his power mass ( his army ) , who be brainwash religion . course , Agamemnon , be game . King must go along charade honestly believe God or not, realize , too late , have ensnare commit despicable filicide.Is sacrifice or murder , and how can tell difference two ? focus violent and primitive horror human sacrifice--and , bad , sacrifice one 's own child--Euripides/Cacoyannis create drama that be once deeply political and agonizingly personal . touch most complex and delicate ethical problem face society : dire conflict need individual society . case Iphigenia , however , as biblical tale Abraham and Isaac , father be ask kill his own child , his own hand . what sort God would insist such payment ? can be just or moral , even divinely inspire ? finally , do daughter 's sacrificial death differ death all son and daughter who be be send war ? be many deep question raise two-hour film .

The Secret Kells be independent , animated feature that give one fabled story surround book Kells , illuminate manuscript Middle Ages feature four Gospels New Testament . do n't know book actually exist , but know now make my interpretation and analysis much lot easier . there be few story and idea float around about how book come be , who write , and how have survive 1,000 year . be one them.We be introduce Brendan , orphan who live Abbey Kells Ireland his uncle , Abbot Cellach ( voice Brendan Gleeson ) . Abbot Cellach be construct massive wall abbey protect villager and monk . Brendan be notfond wall and neither be other monk . be more focus reading and writing , something Abbot Cellach do nothave time anymore . fear " Northman , " who plunder and leave town and village empty and burnt ground.One day traveler come island Iona Scotland . be Brother Aidan , very wise man who carry special book that be notyet finish . Abbot Cellach grant permission stay and Brendan buddy up .

Oliver Stone 's JFK - movie same plot - one do notplay emotion , but concentrate exciting description conspiracy and how everything fit together , draw new picture assassination . even real psychological experiment be use explanation crime scene . compare JFK movie be more reasonable , intelligent and thrilling . part plot can be find lot new movie , have kind deja vu sometimes sit cinema."I ... comme Icare " be " must see " . its unique and brilliant , and music Ennio Morricone be wonderful . movie deserve very good ranking , be Hollywood production would be famous sure .
Jackie Chan 's Police Story be landmark film both Honk Kong action genre and career Jackie Chan.Directed/written Chan , Police Story have basic plot as do all film era and genre , and most film Police Storys ' kind , script be nothing be rave about . but plot film be Jackie Chan , who play nice guy cop , struggle convict local gang lord.The direction film be nothing special and mean good directing effort Jackie Chan have give , responsibility fall underrate masterpiece " Miracles " . however job Jackie do directing be sufficient and respectable . standout direct film come fight scenes.The performance film also vary Jackie give very solid typical Chan nice guy up role , but be mean his good acting role , that can be see Sammo Hung direct film " Heart Dragon " . other actor film also give as good solid performance Jackie Bridgete Lin play her part unwilling witness reasonably well , but neither do display full acting potential . standout acting come Maggie Cheung Jackie ' suffering girlfriend and Bill Tung sympathetic and funny police chief . none performance film be low enough standard affect quality film.The action film be what really separate film other stunning contemporary choreography suit urbanise , modern setting , action be some great fight scene ever put camera . begin there be shootout slum where Koo ( ganglord ) be make drug deal , be John Woo style sequence , serve nice starter film . be then follow famous car run down side hill and heart slum wreck everything sight . be breathtaking sequence that have since be shamelessly copy Bad Boys 2 . middle film be yet standout sequence Jackie try transport Bridgete Lin her house his . be really first scene where get see awesome fast pace hand hand combat that have since become norm modern set martial art film . sequence be fantastically choreograph , time and seamlessly edit together maximise brutality scene . however , tradition dictate , standout fight sequence be end film . sequence display Chans ' good choreography , stunt and camera/editing work . sequence be now famous two thing , amount people send high density glass , which have be say phenomenal amount people , and stunt end where Jackie leap 5th storey balcony , grab hold pole and slide down glass roof ( have be see be believe ) . two for-mentioned factor be uniquely brilliant , i think most impressive part fight sequence be Chans ' ability incorporate anything fight sequence and sheer originality choreography , that have never be better . also believe action Police Story be well film and edit action Chans career help set action apart others.Overall , Police Story , its unspectacular storyline and script and run middle due plot padding , be one good action film time display Chans good choreography , good film action and arguably his most spectacular stunt make essential viewing everyone . Afterall , watch Chan movie action ! !

series get Deighton 's writing and genre when be young and love presentation story . would however disagree above comment . what have read past , be notHolm 's performance lead Deighton refuse have series release but butcher three book receive translation screen . great example be rewrite boarder crossing that end Samson 's field career . scene be notbook , character who die minefield be never book and crossing Sinker be East Germany West Germany , notPolish frontier . whole storyline be cloth . change Set similarly damage integrity story . my perspective Holm 's performance be portray disorientation Samson his wife 's defection excellently and believe comport well portray age field agent desperately try bridge class divide . Samson both pay his father 's idealism and suffer due its influence his life . Clevemore comment , have get education would have probably be run department . think true loss performance be due physical appearance more anything . Holm be diminutive when compare Samson book - physically impressive man capable use his size impose presence .

 Sudden Impact tend be treat Eastwood 's artistic failure point his career when have establish good reputation director . reason be actually notfilm but attitude take vigilantism which seem support . place actually owe more Death Wish original Dirty Harry film . might argue that be so- end day be film guilt , justice and retribution . , end day be more empathy sympathy . however , view all argument be easily overlook sudden impact be awfully well make film . forget " go ahead punk , make my day scene " , that be iconic but notoriginal . but look view San Fransisco take air , zoom city . first 15 or 20 minute be quite spectacular . or have look brilliantly make scene where Sondra Locke 's character visit her mentally ill sister hospital . Eastwood make great use juxtaposition face . so all Sudden Impact be very visual film that really show how mature Eastwood be as director . and remember correctly be actually first time Eastwood put screen action film debatable ideology . also , think be first well pace film Eastwood direct . Eastwood have enormous talent director , dramaturgy have always be his weak point ( see Play Misty , Breezy etc. ) Thepace narrative lead visual element be well integrate film and notdistract story . only thing that be really annoy be fart dog .

 Ride Devil have something rich and special , can stand slow development . tackle dark , gritty subject , brutal guerrilla war American west its Civil War ( which in turn spawn outlaw old west 1870s ) , movie maintain strangely satisfying , unmanipulated atmosphere . what be refer be tendency film ' music and light make feel mood will expect feel . but RWTD instead have relatively upbeat soundtrack , and let word and action do talking set mood rather manipulation viewer 's senses.As enthusast particular area CW history , be greatly impress accuracy film . diologue be expertly write , ( even subtle humor occasionally ) reference bushwhacker and previous boarder battle ( independence example ... far cry Oregon Trail ! ) . minor event that occur Jake 's band be similar actual event that take place ... especially attack when be hole up house , and destruction store/booth . battle scene , though rare , be pretty well execute . even have first CW cavalry battle put film recently.The directing show talent everyone expect Ang Lee subtle way . example : character Black John be show taunt Lawrence resident massacre : " where be your army ? who be fight ! ? who be fight ? ! ( shot then switch trio Confederate Regulars standing , do nothing stop carnage voice continue ) be coward all ! " who be coward , really ? little touch like really enhance movie 's quality.There be major glaring area history , something that can notbe say masterpiece film glory , which be basically fiction context major event follow . minor problem include fact year as show event represent do n't add up . but will never notice . large curiosity be fact only African-American man-at-arms character film be quasi-slave fighting Jake and his Confederate bushwhacker . be true black do fight confederacy there , include one who scout Lawrence Quantrill attack ( who would suspect ? ) . black rebel be fasinating character ( whatever PC African-Americans might think ) , notsingle black Union infantryman be see film , which would have be more represenative black experience Western CW . One first black regiment CW be raise Kansas ( murderer Senator Jim Lane , and 54th Mass. Reg. fame be organize ) , and black troop such battle Baxter Springs , KS , play critical role.No glare historical error . good , realistic action , which be infrequent and notgratitous . good directing . film may notbe blockbuster other recent Civil War be , but be clean job .

The Waiting Womans Ward large lying-in hospital , all its joy and sorrow , be place where Life BEGINS.This nearly forget drama be fine little soap opera , replete comedy and tragedy , all tie life maternity staff and their patient . frankness which subject matter be handle point movie 's pre-Code status.Marvelous Aline Macmahon , sympathetic head nurse , be calm center film , rock which current flow . able handle crisis or emergency , be mother ' good , sometimes last , friend . surround Macmahon be bevy excellent costar : Loretta Young convict murderess release prison long enough give birth ; Eric Linden her frightened young husband ; brassy Glenda Farrell dame who hate child ; sweet Clara Blandick very mature mother her sixth birth ; Preston Foster & Hale Hamilton thoughtful , compassionate doctor and Frank McHugh comically frantic father-to-be.Movie maven will recognize Bob Watson wee tyke who want see Stork ; Paul Fix nervous husband who promise behave ` little soldier ; ' Gilbert Roland distraught Italian husband and Elizabeth Patterson snooty doctor 's wife interested adopt Farrell 's son - uncredited.There be few absurdity plot - mother be obviously much too old ; Farrell become blatantly drunk Ward but none staff seem notice ; obviously psychotic patient be able wander around will - but really only enhance quirky entertainment value film and keep thing become too serious .
its about time Gunga Din be release DVD . can accurately say how many time have watch fine film but , never tire . lead actor work so well together . Victor Mclaglen ( Sgt McChesney ) , Cary Grant ( Sgt Cutter ) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr ( Sgt Ballentine ) be unbeatable team.I just can get over their exploit India . your first glimpse Sergeants Three , be when see engage fight other soldier so-called treasure map . three sergeant be send expedition find out what happen communication line enter mostly desert town- or so think.They engage necessary repair and soon find few " resident " hiding . soon get attack group madman and barely make escape back base.Later be send mission which give Sgt Cutter chance go hunting gold Din . find temple gold and be trap evil Kali supporter .

think ROTJ be clearly good out three Star Wars movie . find surprising ROTJ be consider weak installment trilogy who have vote . seem ROTJ be good have most profound plot , most suspense , surprise , most emotional,(especially ending ) and definitely most episodic movie . personally like Empire Strike back lot also but think be slightly less good ROTJ be slower-moving , be notas episodic , and just do notfeel much suspense or emotion do third movie.It also seem read surprising review reason people cite ROTJ be inferior film other two be just plain ludicrous and be insignificant reason compare sheer excellence film whole . have hear many strange reason such : ) Yoda die b ) Bobba Fett die c ) small Ewoks defeat band stormtroopers d ) Darth Vader be revealedI would like debunk reason believe miss point completely . first off , who CARES Bobba Fett die ? ? ? George Lucas want die then want die . do n't get wrong be fan Bobba Fett but make few cameo appearance and be notLucas ' intention make central character film Star Wars fan make out be . his name be noteven mention anywhere movie ... have go credit find out Bobba Fett 's name ! ! ! judge ROTJ minor character die be bit much think ... secondly , many fan do notYoda die . sure , be momentous period movie . be nothappy see die either but make movie more realistic . all good guy ca n't stay alive realistic movie , know . otherwise ALL good guy live and ALL bad guy die movie would have be tantamount cheesy Saturday morning cartoon . aspect point people notlike Yoda 's death. . well , nobody complain when Darth Vader strike down Obi Wan Kenobi New Hope . ( many consider New Hope be good trilogy ) why be Obi Wan 's death okay but Yoda 's not... hmmmmmmmmmmmm ... . reason just can notbelieve be even state be people find cute Ewoks overpower stormtroopers be impossible . be utterly ridiculous ! ! can notbelieve one ! ! first off , Ewoks be their native planet Endor be cognizant their home terrain live there . watch movie carefully many tactic Ewoks use defeat stormtroopers be excellent use their home field advantage . ( live forest your life hope would have learn use your advantage ) have swing vine , rope , log set up trip walker , and other traps . stormtroopers be highly disadvantaged be outnumber and notaware advantage forest . only thing have be their blasters . add , be notEwoks be battle stormtroopers , be heavily assist band rebel conquest . think stormtroopers be have defeat combination Star Wars hero , band rebel , as well huge clan Ewoks great familiarity their home terrain , that would have be great upset . lastly , scene be still unbelievable you. . how about Empire Strike back or New Hope where there be SEVERAL scene group consist just Han Solo , Chewbacca , and Princess , be shoot like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters miss hero be full view ! ! and notonly , hero , course , always hit Stormtroopers their blasters . trooper must have VERY , VERY bad aim then ! least Empire Strike back , Battle Endor be much more believable have two army pit other not3 hero legion stormtroopers . do n't believe ? check battle Cloud City when our hero be escape Lando 's base . or when our hero be rescue Princess Leia and be shoot ( somehow missed)as Han Solo and Luke be try exit Death Star.The last reason care discuss ( other be just too plain ridiculous spend my time here . ) be people do notDarth Vader be reveal ! well , many way that be major part plot movie . Luke be try find or notDarth Vader be his father , Annakin Skywalker . would have be disappointing movie have end Luke get see his father 's face make complete . Annakin 's revelation symbolize transition Darth Vader undergo be possess dark side ( his helmet ) and good person be Annakin Skywalker ( remove helmet ) . point be Annakin die convert light side again and be what meaning helmet removal scene be about . fact , that have be what would have do scene too be Luke 's father ... be n't what would have do want see your son your own eye die and notmechanized helmet ? note , think subconscious or conscious expectation most people be sequel must be bad ( even be good ) preceding movie be reason ROTJ do notget many accolade deserve . never go film deception mind , always try go film attitude " well , might be good or bad that original . . but can notknow sure. . let be see . " way go open mind and do notdupe think clearly superior film be notas good really was.I be notsure who criticize movie but , have ask many college student and adult which be their favorite Star Wars movie and all tell ( one person that say New Hope be their favorite ) be ROTJ . believe result poll be appalling and quite misleading.Bottom line , return Jedi be good trilogy . movie be only one three that keep rivet its 135 minute . there be notmoment boredom scene be either suspenseful , exciting , surprising , or above . example , emotional light saber battle Luke and his father ROTJ be good one Empire Strike back day ! ! ! finally , hope people go see Phantom Menace open mind fan start look nitpicky , insignificant detail ( or see " just sequel " ) trash movie such " movie stink Luke be not! " then meritorious film will become spectacular movie that will be subject derision ROTJ suffer unfortunately .

film be close be my favorite piece celluloid . there be really notmuch will need or want say here . maybe " see film " and " Enjoy excellent work Daniel and Pascal " , who carry neat , funny and heartbreaking story about ' spend your eighth day ' - your own day ! see film make think seriously about how spend my eighth day = my life ! appear , be waste precious time do thing think need do . either be please career or just consume TV-shows and ballgames . what tend miss be satisfaction be something person - make difference . take room and time be spontaneous and live - now ! ( eighth day ) ... least be what got ' Eighth Day ' .
I Love movie . Director Michael Powell once state be his favorite movie , and be mine as well . Powell and Pressburger create seemingly simple , superbly craft story - power love " power that be " . however , its deception lie complexity its " be real or be imaginary " premise . basically , could argue be simply depiction effect war young , poetically incline airman WWII . or be ? question be never answer one way or other . actually , be never even ask . continuous understatement be part film 's appeal.The innovative photography and cinematography even include nice touch portray interest filmmaker . instance , Pressburger always want do cinematic version Richard Strauss ' opera , Der Rosenkavalier , young 18th century Viennese aristocrat . be evident brief interlude which Conductor 71 , dress all his finery , hold rose ( which appear silver heaven ) . music even have dreamy quality.All acting be first rate - David Niven be his most charming , and have excellent support veteran Roger Livesey and relative newcomer Kim Hunter . but , my opinion , film 's charm come Marius Goring Conductor 71 . by far have most interesting role , fill his scene his innocent lightheartedness , brighten film . be pity Conductor 71 's scene be leave cut room floor . be also pity Goring 's comedic talent be rarely see again film , wonderful video Scarlet Pimpernel television series 1950s . be far and away most memorable role his film career . be perfect foil relax style Niven , and his virtual overstatement contrast so nicely seriousness rest character . ironically , also mid -1940s , Niven also star heavenly " messenger " , play Cary Grant , Bishop 's wife . their acting style be so similar find result boring , unenergetic , and disappointing . note , accord Powell , Goring desperately want role Peter Carter , initially refuse Conductor 71 . be good thing give and give such delightful portrayal.The movie , " commission " smooth strained relation Britain and U.S. , overdrive its point end . but be disarm its gentle reminder horror war - numerous casualty , both military and civilian , need " go " when face death . there be conspicuous lack WWII " enemy " heaven , but civilian show be indeterminate origin . Powell and Pressburger could have be more explicit their depiction but be n't necessary . movie may nothave serve its diplomatic purpose as be hope , but its originality continue inspire moviemaker and viewer alike side Atlantic .
First see movie know anything just know Joel Schumacher do and be enough . friend and go see Danish film festival call night-film festival which be lot different movie show hour festival pretty much specialize show movie that would n't otherwise be show Danish theaters.Anyway my friend and go see and be astonish how real seem and really strike cord our feeling , really get catch up plot be able figure out ending which be great plus our book.The film be record style that remind Danish initiative " dogma 95 " which be start 4 Danish director include Lars Von Trier ( Dancer Dark).In conclusion movie be really worth see give different perspective how thing be American G.I. Joe come out school be expect serve their country battle long way home.Also Colin Farrell be exceptional movie have n't see but ca n't wait see more him.Lars P. Helvard

just see film 2001 Toronto international film festival . work title there be ' Dog Days ' . audience reaction be mix . people find graphic sex and realistic violence be too much . other seem genuinely appreciate how good film was.This film be n't faint heart . be like ' happiness ' explicit sex and less optimistic view humanity . there be animal poisoning , strip-tease senior citizen , orgy'esque ' bathouse shopping centre , anal candle penetration , and molestation mentally incompetent.If sound too much handle then film be n't . film show humanity its most desperate and pathetic . banality our existence be shove our face utmost glee.Seidl have interest redeem humanity here . and why should ? film feature excellent performance involve , be always interesting , and be probably most intelligent social statement be make film awhile .
The act movie be superb . amateur rocketeer , find very few mistake . human be , touch my heart and soul . watch actor , would think be actual character . Laura Dern , favorite actress mine , leave nothing out her performance . young actor play Rocket Boys show talent their year , especially young Homer . Homer 's father inspire eternal love/hate relationship father and son that feel real . do n't get lump your throat or shed tear when first successful rocket go up or when father and son come term , then get your pulse check ( may be dead ) .
child always hate be force sit musical . never understand why people would break out song , and be far too young appreciate artistry ( choreography , set design , costume , pace ) all . Carol Reed 's " Oliver ! " be one musical remember oddly enjoy child , probably be one dark one and be appropriately drench spirit Dickensian squalor . be musical ghetto life Victorian London , and scenery and set design be stark , dark , and true way life , be flat out bizarre people be break out such ridiculous song their misery . recent viewing , my first childhood , have new thought and insight why musical " work " bizarre break out song kind way , and why most just do n't do me.When musical work or really say something , be realize their own inherent strangeness . Lars von Trier 's " Dancer Dark " as tragic and operatic and reach be , work musical musical number be product imagination protagonist , immigrant obsess Hollywood musical . likewise , very cynical and enjoyable " Chicago " work similar level musical number be product homicidal ingenue singer/dancer . musical do n't work when take their own musical-nature too seriously ( " Moulin Rouge " ) or be simply too much fluff nothing ( i.e. something pointless " Mary Poppins " ) . view " Oliver ! " first time adult , see new light . tell mostly point view young Oliver , see musical number product his childhood imagination and his way cope horror ghetto life . well musical number be probably when Nancy get everyone tavern sign and dance joy get drunk ( cover help poor Oliver escape clutch evil Bill Sykes ) . be undeniably catchy and sound real pub tune drunk might start sing around piano . there be other great and classic tune be hear here , and direction and act lead dancing extra be top notch.Still , all its bleakness ( do have happy ending Oliver least , certainly thing do n't end happily Nancy , and think life street be pick-pocket be fun , be n't necessarily good ending Fagin or Dodger , their peppy closing tune ) would n't really classify family film , do n't think show kid age seven or eight will do harm . be harsh tale unfortunate orphan try survive street and find happiness . think would be very interesting see modern update some how , perhaps revisionist take , where people street Compton break happy song their horrible life . will like see hard-edged hip-hop version " Oliver ! " . always think Dickens would translate well regard . stand , " Oliver ! " be probably last great film musical and maybe strange G-rated film have ever see .
 Simply put , Oliver ! be one great musical time . be fill memorable song - " Food Glorious Food " , " Oliver ! " , " consider Yourself " and " Oom-Pah-Pah " name just few - and equally memorable characters.The film be musical adaptation Charles Dickens ' classic novel and much story Oliver Twist , be perfect family film . there be frightening moment - villain Bill Sykes play Oliver Reed be scary enough his own - but overall , film will appeal child age as well adults.The story - which almost everyone be surely familiar now - revolve little orphan boy name Oliver and his life grow up London . first live workhouse rest his fellow orphan but dare question Mr. Bumble , overseer , be sell family servant.After series mishap and close shave , meet Artful Dodger - superbly play young Jack Wild , who give his all role - and , greedy Fagin ( Ron Moody ) , who train young boy pick pocket treasure which keep himself.The film be shoot solely studio and soundstages Shepperton Film Studios but do nottranslate all film . set perfectly replicate Victorian London , as do costume wear character . multi-Oscar winner and massive success its release , Oliver ! be worthy contender well musical all time and will delight anyone who love film .

This be one good movie have see . movie relate real life and how drug Can play major part . movie appear be produce low budget , find be exhilarate watch.Some may notlike story and say script be lack direction . however , when person get as deep drug character , there be direction be life . feel movie be accurate representation what might happen person be face extreme temptations.Most cast be newcomer industry . however , all pull off very well . everyone seem do their job well and get character appropriately.I think movie might be good tool use when deal person or love one that be involve drug and appear be spiral out control . movie might just scare enough change their way .
Okay - will confess . be movie that make love what Michael Keaton could do . do beautiful parody someone do parody James Cagney , charm spare.The support cast be solid worker all , and will step right up and do fine job this ' 80s comedy . spoof the ' 30s-'40s gangster movie , break new ground constantly , remarkably original material . ( well , yeah - have be copy - but when movie be make , be original , and much have _not_ be copy elsewhere . ) Watch Joe Piscopo warn people notdo ______ , one great taglines spoof . watch Roman Moronie do thing English profanity that would make your spinster grammar teacher laugh . watch amazing sight gag , such pet-store owner Johnny Kelly use price-tag gun his puppy and dust his kitten . watch great " warn sex " educational film ever make . watch most amazing misrepresentation church Latin do , guy who never take shop class assemble Thompson machine gun part . watch line will be use casual conversation next decade . watch Maureen Stapleton do perfect antithesis hard-working mom , surprise gag will never see coming.If see gag that do n't hit your funny bone , be patient - will come along 30 second or less , and odd be , will need pause be do roll floor several time . ducky and bunny ? , too . watch subtle stuff - sight gag can go unnoticed first few viewings.There be few minor flaw - but be probably good spoof . come close , but none be quite good .
This be great movie view proper context - be mean be parody teen-horror-devil-worship movie ( and the ' 80s saw plenty ) ! see movie when first come out , and instantly like . be big fan Kiss , be great see Gene movie . and anything Ozzy metal-hating preacher ca n't be all bad ! also , Fastway be already favorite mine , so be great hear soundtrack.The original VBS ( be pre-DVD ) cover Trick or Treat feature illustration Sammi kneel , play his guitar ring fire " demon " look . be special order , and price VBS copy time ( 1987 ) be $90 ! really want movie , but notridiculous price .

author " Nekromantik " , Jrg Buttgereit 's second feature film , " Der Todesking " be powerful masterpiece . center chain letter originate group call " Brotherhood 7th day " , movie show 7 episode , consist one day one week , where suicide be approach use different character and situation all letter be make 's round . do nottouch one like Hollywood movie or musical , enjoy happy or even remotely " normal " movie or expect movie be good only , be focus stage acting.The nihilistic , avant-garde approach Der Todesking well explain , why Buttgereit 's movie general be ban Germany , their native country origin , 80 be and most 90 's . Der Todesking be notreally focus character appear on-screen , but meaningless apathy or depression most people 's life consist general . Buttgereit do notfind reason go living , only reason stop , and choose how and when die , can also be king death , Der Todesking.Buttgereit 's movie be generally difficult categorize and Der Todesking be exception . feature same crew and almost same cast other his movie , " art film " would probably be close description time . Der Todesking feature original method shoot , create mood and handle central object almost scene . one scene , camera slowly , continuously pan 360 degree circle , person live small one-room apartment day . , Buttgereit use sound and film corruption depict collapse mental state man , dwell his desperation . third , seemingly pleasant scene name , age and occupation actual people have commit suicide be show on-screen , supposedly warrant ban Germany particular movie.Episode movie ( and especially one , scene be only vaguely connect ) generally suffer incoherence , and Der Todesking be exception . episode have same focus inflict death and 's consequence or subsequence be variation , there be very powerful episode , yet episode or two might even seem filler material , partly drain overall power movie - still , jaw-dropping , immensely powerful intermission depict decompose body manage keep movie together and cleanse be more vague moment back status greatness . general atmosphere be baffle , awe-inspiring , highly depress and sometimes even disgusting - so much so dozen people leave middle movie theater show film festival take part of.This be one movie that do leave lasting impression and strongly recommend anyone look special experience and something will definitely remember year come . notrecommend faint heart or show time fan , be small , different movie that truly raise feeling audience . be confusion , amazement or even hate , be n't likely be leave cold , my opinion good , achievement small indie crew.The main theme movie , " die Fahrt in Reich der Menschentrmmer part I-III " be release limited 666-piece 8 " vinyl edition , which be now much seek . still can get classical masterpiece get " Nekromantik " soundtrack CD , which highly recommend . Lo-Fi synthesizer music movie be dark and quirky , almost illbient-like , make essential part movie 's atmosphere , and be something would very , very rarely hear otherwise . much recommend !
Sure Star Wars ( movie have see least fifty time ) beat all other special effect , but film have thing else ! have horror(non-graphical) , romance , robot , witty repartee , intelligence , ( surprisingly good ) special effect , and drama.I see film couple year ago revival newly strike print , and be amaze how well hold up today . think old 40 's style electronics would look hokey , but somehow look futuristic and moderne.Ann Francis here ( mostly ) short skirt and bare foot girlish innocence that be hard beat still get rise out me.The Krell monster appear ray beam still scare bejebees out me.Of course all know " Great Bird Galaxy " probably model much " Star Trek " movie.No have yet beat Robby , Robot , term personality(sorry , R2D2 and C3PO).This movie , overall , be standard other science fiction film will have measure up ! Honorable mention haunting electronic score which keep all pin and needle .

Miike 's goal be meet , though just meet , his low-scale ambition : gangster picture add level harsh familial trouble ( main tension brother come out profession and duty parent ) , note cruel aspect underworld crime , and what realm unrepentant sex , sex , bring out psychologically character . same time , Shinjuku Triad Society also contain more few moment classic biting black-comedy Miike oeuvre . just have be take grain salt what director do his outrageousness , bit beginning chair smashing face , or randomness " interrogation " go very twisted area . there be even laugh-out-loud line young sex-slave finish act one boss : " thank , Mr. Weeny-Burger . " Miike and his writer do n't have enough here make film full-on dark comedy Ichi or , course , Visitor Q , but there be enough bring appropriate levity dark aspect story and characters.As first entry " Black Society " trilogy , be call , be quite impress , and be fine quasi-calling card one crazy new artist contemporary cinema .

be always surprise about how many time will see something World War 2 German national television . would think do n't like open old wound , but there be n't week that go documentary or movie horror and atrocity war . perhaps be way deal their past , do n't know , but sure ca n't blame ignore what happen . and have be say : most documentary be really worth watch never try gloss truth and same can be say their movie ( think instance " Der Untergang " or " Downfall " might now ) which be also very realistic.One movie be " Rosenstrasse " . tell true story and deal subject mixed marriage war , even movie start family USA , present day . Hannah 's father die , mother all sudden turn orthodox jew even have n't be very religious before . do n't know where strange behavior her mother come , but start dig her mother 's troubled childhood , Hannah understand how little have ever know her mother 's past.The fact movie deal subject mixed marriage Nazi regime be already quite surprising . as far know , there have n't be movie deal subject . ( who do n't know yet : be marry so-called pure Aryian man or woman mean many Jews be n't immediately send one concentration camp , but have work factory ) . but do notonly tell something problem mixed marriage , also give good idea how people be often see their own parent and relative . how difficult sometimes be Nazi regime and how people , most time woman , do everything their power free their man , once be capture and lock away instance Rosenstrasse ... acting be really good and story be very well write , way be present beginning do n't really do ( and be exactly only part will get see trailer ) . perhaps be just , but would have leave out big part what happen present day . least part that be situate USA , part where Hannah go Berlin and talk someone who know more her mother 's past , definitely works.If be interested everything that have something do Second World War , and be n't necessarily look lot action shot , be definitely movie should see . be n't movie which will see battle or gunfight , but certainly be interesting movie , give idea aspect war only little be know . give positive .

 Lost be good TV series there is.First all,it have great actor and wonderful directing.The writing be very controversial issue first two season writing be extraordinary but season 3 writing become highly complex.For instance,who be Jacob ? why be there polar bear island ? what be fog ? how do island disappear ? who be Richard Alpert ? lot people think writer be lose and have raise lot question and mystery ca n't explain.I believe people be wrong.I have confidence writers.I think mystery be reveal now all charm series will be gone.Anyway,lost be undeniably great TV series and will continue be long time .

Thats one problem - stupid break convention - criminal fascination . throw away - and go nowhere ! but actress play difficult part very interesting . other side - there parent - who be pendant two girl . have car - hotel suite - have money and live world music opera . but film stand always distance seem . there be much explain them.In center film , there be one scene will never forget . two girl get casting . and there should say how find together . scene Toni will lie . say fantastic story-has nothing do . and then Nina will say truth . say introversion way . there be exhibition . look bottom and say what will happen here .

Walt Disney 's " Rookie " be base story Jim Morris , former minor league picher who make one most amazing comeback sport history , end almost 10 year retirement and make his Major League debut 1999 age 35.The film open brief synopsis Morris ' childhood , which include series re-locations - his father be military man . and even when his family settle good football craze Texas , Morris ' passion baseball remain strong.The childhood segment then jump ahead about 23 year adult Morris ( play Dennis Quaid ) who be now baseball coach and chemistry teacher Big Lake High School ( real life be Reagan County High School Big Lake , Texas ) . be mention attempt career baseball player but do n't work out.Morris 's team be struggle and lecture give up their dream . turn table , tell should try out Major League team . several time when pitch practice , express amazement speed which throw . Morris seem unconvinced but agree deal his player which win district , will try out Major League team.Big Lake do win district and , adhere his end deal , Morris attend Tampa Bay Devil Ray try out . phenomenally , throw 98 mile hour - fast throw his minor league career and outstanding speed even Major League pitcher . try out team , Morris be offer contract Devil Rays.This leave tough decision - stay his comfortable life or once again pursue his Major League dream go minor league grind make little money and spending month time away home . and decision be even more agonize his first minor league stint now have wife and three children.Morris sign Devil Ray , begin AA level and move up quickly AAA level , one level Major League Baseball . but season wind down , chance get " call up " grow increasingly slim.For most part , love movie . there be lot great performance and likable character and be easy find really pull Morris . also , movie do great job portray professional baseball both major and minor league level . and most , teach timeless message hold tight your dream even when seem distant and almost impossible achieve.Still , movie have flaw . generally accurate , exaggerate and even fabricate few thing . check http://espn.go.com/page2/s/closer/020410.html example . also , one scene which pray his player , movie completely ignore Morris ' Christian faith . but consider Disney 's leave wing zeal , that be notsurprising.Presumably , lot exaggerations/fabrications be do make story more dramatic . yet 20 minute documentary Morris that be include DVD feature information that make his story more dramatic but be exclude movie.For example , birth his family settle Texas good when be 12 , Morris re-located 14 time . and his initial minor league career end four surgery which lose half muscle his left ( pitching ) shoulder , thus make his throw 98 mph even more inexplicable.To fully appreciate and understand story Jim Morris , be good notonly watch " Rookie " but watch DVD 's documentary , check out aforementioned link movie 's inaccuracy and probably also read Morris ' biography , also title " Rookie . " have n't read book but hope one days.But overall , " Rookie " be very good portrayal miraculous story and be powerful testament power dream and triumph common man . positive

Don Cheadle play his former college roommate who unexpectedly reconnect Charlie and take his mission help get well . course , Cheadle 's Alan Johnson have his own problem and source unhappiness , and somehow two man manage help other their difficulty . two make completely believable team , and Sandler particular make Charlie real , work his emotion and feeling . be notSandler comedy . your look that go his other , silly , stuff . be pretty heavy movie - sometimes sad , sometimes hopeful and always engross . there be funny part . love scene which Charlie convince Alan confront his partner remind how tough be college , and then conversation two have afterward.I personally do n't think Saffron Burrows add much movie Donna , obviously needy patient Johnson 's . only reason character seem ( base one flashback ) be look eerily Charlie 's late wife , but that be never really develop , and just do n't care much character . do look part judge , however , play Donald Sutherland , who think nail part bang-on . as far be concern , though , be Sandler 's movie , and kudos great performance . definitely his good my opinion . positive

Poor Guinness 's suit be notonly white and stain repellent , but glow neon sign.Other Guinness good performance be Cecil Parker yet pompous oaf , Joan Greenwood his siren daughter and Ernest Thesiger big clothing manufacturer UK>Come think , do Paramount borrow suit Ealing and give John Travolta Saturday Night Fever ?

Robert A. Heinlein 's classic novel Starship Troopers have be mess around recent year , everything Paul Verhoeven 's 1997 film TV series , number game . but none , so speak , have really capture spirit his novel . game be usually unrelated , TV series be more spin off , and less say Verhoeven 's film , well . little do most know , however , Japan , animated adaptation have already be do , release year Heinlein 's death . and , believe or not, its difference , 6-part animated series be , plot-wise , most faithful adaptation Heinlein 's classic.The most obvious plus series be presence power armor exoskeleton , something be deprive Verhoeven 's film . book , series focus more character and their relationship action and space travel , see fair amount . event happen differently book , feel book 's plot be present . Rico and Carmen have romantic entanglement , but be only slightly more touch upon book . may believe dialogue and character interaction be bit inferior book ( get bit anime treatment , but what do expect ? ) , but be far superior film . Heinlein 's political view be merely excise , as oppose film , where be reverse . big payoff series , however , be climatic battle Klendathu trooper and bugs/aliens , which feature kind action power armor suit would have like have see film version.Overall , enjoy series want see vision closer Heinlein . and think do pretty well . can find series , give look .
 BEFORE THE DEVIL Knows 'RE Dead start off promisingly , set up simple heist that go awry , tell vary perspective ( RASHOMON style ) . hour mark , Sidney Lumet transform film something that be so much more sum its part ; eventually morph multi-faceted family drama , explore full realm human emotions/relations , story come its chilling climax.As be case Lumet , manage coax exceptional performance his star-studded cast , notion over-acting or hyperbole . Philip Seymour Hoffman , one his good role , be complex , mysterious , and interesting character , and oftentime dwarf Ethan Hawke , who play his brother , Hank . be notsay Hawke be notbad ; fact be quite above adequate , troubled role that suit his style . Marisa Tomei be excellent her relatively short appearance ( fact bare her flesh add ) . Albert Finney 's character ( Andy and Hank 's father ) be most intriguing , and my opinion , deserve bit more screen-time . Amy Ryan also perform her job adequately.BEFORE DEVIL Knows 'RE Dead be notexceptional movie , but prove Lumet be still top his game ( apparent ) twilight illustrious career . many his characteristic and trademark appear here , notleast which involve use his character . infuse killer script ( pun intend ) , smart dialogue and pace , and decent score , BEFORE THE DEVIL Knows 'RE Dead be must-see . truly underrate gem . positive . 3 star ( out 4 ) . should just enter my top 250 248 . highly recommend .
Mary Pickford often state Tess Skinner be her favorite movie role . well say ! play part twice and version which produce , notonly have purchase right Adolph Zukor but even give credit film 's main title card . needless say her portrayal role here be most winning . indeed , my opinion , movie rate one all-time great experience silent cinema.True , director John S. Robertson do n't move his camera inch start finish , but Robertson 's skillful hand affectation notonly do n't matter but be probably more effective . creative artist first rank , Robertson be master pace , camera angle and montage . have also draw brilliantly natural performance all his player . Jean Hersholt who enact heavy be so hideously repulsive , be hard believe be same man kindly Dr Christian ; Lloyd Hughes render one well acting job his entire career . true , be probably notway Mrs White intend , but serve plot admirably , otherwise would have difficulty explain why dope spend fortune defense but make notslight attempt ascertain who actually fire gun that kill his future brother-in-law ! needless say , particular quality likable hero be downplay Jack Ging bowdlerize 1960 version which also totally delete author 's trenchant attack smug , middle-class Christianity . notice how well-washed priest here move forward pace or two surprise interruption , but then make attempt whatever assist our plucky little heroine performance duty be supposedly ordain administer . be very move scene indeed be so realistically presented."Tess " also provide insight work fine actress , Gloria Hope , whose work be entirely confine silent cinema . marry Lloyd Hughes 1921 and retire 1926 devote her life completely her husband and their two child . Lloyd Hughes die 1958 , but live 1976 , easily contactable Pasadena , but bet no-one have brain interview . opportunity lose ! , Forrest Robinson only make middling impression Skinner . think be slightly miscast and brief glance his filmography prove : usually play priest or judge ! but David Torrence usual be superb.In all , expensive production beautiful photography and marvelous production value .

Zelah Clarke ( Jane Eyre ) and Timothy Dalton ( Jane 's lover , name Rochester ) capture brilliantly essence their character . can imagine anyone else their role . ( other performance Rochester other version such 2006 version lack passion , energy , and tenderness need portray Rochester accurately . say Timothy Dalton come out top possess all characteristic his portrayal Rochester . Zelah Clarke notonly look Jane Eyre , but capture Jane 's quiet , but firm and passionate nature brilliantly . hold her emotion , Jane book , appropriate moment story but allow her fire come out Jane 's passionate scene . chemistry Clarke and Dalton portray their scene together be also credible and true Jane and Rochester 's devoted relationship . ) well , support actor also fit their role perfectly , and set fit Gothic nature story.I strongly recommend version classic Bronte tale . have notread book before , then can watch production faithful introduction beautiful story .

Daniel Day Lewis my Left Foot give one good performance ever actor . be brilliant Christy Brown , man who have cerebral palsy , who then learn write and paint his left foot . well deserve Oscar and Brenda Fricker who play his loving mother . Hugh O'Conner be terrific young Christy Brown and Ray Mcanally be great father . worth watching outstanding performance .
movie should be require view librarian or would-be librarian . good line be directly relate librarianship . public library academic library argument be classic argument wage librarian and library school student . also break many librarian stereotype . librarian might even be capable have fun -- even do n't *usually* have sex romance language section ! ( good movie librarian ? desk Set , Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy , course . )
 Musically speak Irving Berlin give Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers pluperfect musical Top Hat that be possible . case Jerome Kern confection Roberta be , Follow Fleet retain Randolph Scott singer , time Harriet Hilliard.Randolph Scott be career Navy CPO and Fred Astaire be ex-vaudevillian who enlist Navy forget Ginger Rogers his former partner . but now two be shore leave .

Ginger get do really outstanding vocalize Let Yourself Go which and Fred later dance . but real hit show be Let 's Face music and dance which be number do Navy show . sing first Astaire and later dance pair , Let 's Face Music and Dance be one great romantic number ever write screen . their dancing one be absolute magic.I be sure when mention Harriet Hilliard few young people might ask who be . but will know immediately when mention conjunction her famous husband Ozzie Nelson . be right Ozzie and Harriet . be something mystery why Harriet stop sing when just become David and Ricky 's mom television . then again do n't even keep her own name.Neither Ozzie or Harriet sing television . Ozzie be pale imitation Rudy Vallee singer , but Harriet could really carry tune . sing get Thee Me Satan and Moon and be here , but where be , both real feeling and class . recommend see Follow Fleet other reason hear dimension Harriet Hilliard incredibly forget today .

sometimes realism can work effectiveness film . be problem here . set be cheesy , inside and out . fog be ubiquitous , half disguise shabbiness production . there be bar , name paint front window say simply , " Wine and Spirits . " result be claustrophobic set scene . notsingle shot city or even fake skyline . be kind Dublin story be about , just Jack Ripper movie be about seedy , foggy , cobblestoned Whitechapel . who would want other way ? how could have be other way bankable star , minuscule budget , and four-week shoot schedule ? acting follow suit -- outrageously hammy everyone 's part . sometimes , my God , be positively excruciating . Mrs. Mcphillips moan Frankie be shoot dead house .

McLaglen , real dummy , bump his head hang sign . fog . blind man . but what impress be how little be be try time . what strike overly arty today be 1936 something quite different what be see most programmer be grind out time . fall short time , do n't matter . movie be act courage , politically and morally as well poetically . ( legion decency condemn scene brothel . ) director 's goal should exceed his grasp , or what be script ? watch now , however , 2006 , story be more disturbing ever . John Ford obviously sympathize Irish rebel . kill , but only out what see necessity . ( " know too much live . what go Tans ? oh , be notme-self be think but , Ireland .

probably one prime example follow suspenseful , dramatic episode ( case , superb balance Terror ) light affair , Shore leave be first true attempt behalf Star Trek writer produce more entertaining piece sci-fi , and formula be n't quite right yet entry ( true triumph be trouble Tribble , Season 2 ) , laugh come pretty fast as long viewer be willing allow all silliness.Diverting show 's tradition , enterprise be n't proper mission episode . instead , Kirk have find perfect planet his crew spend time duty : well deserve break three month incessant work . Earth-like planet ( budget-related fact ) be very appealing , but only take few minute something weird happen : Dr. McCoy start have vision white rabbit that seem come straight out Lewis Carroll 's work . soon , other people begin experience similar thing : woman meet Don Juan-like character , Sulu have run-in samurai , and Kirk face double encounter past , shape almost love and guy who use pick Academy . throw freakishly real-looking tiger , and be easy see why Kirk and Spock be determine figure out what be go anybody get hurt.The idea be classic one : idyllic place turn out be far heavenly . episode 's humorous take topic be rather successful , be n't dark turn event that do n't sit well rest ( course , everything work out fine again come end ) and cast 's general unwillingness show funny side ( most notably , and ironically , otherwise hilarious William Shatner ) . and yet Shore leave deserve recognition be good example writer try new , previously unseen thing : definition Star Trek 's success.7,negative
be really unfortunate most people outside Canada think only thing Canada produce be snow , Mountie and hockey player . film be second superlative Canadian film have see past few week ( first be " Red Violin " ) , far good but good Hollywood efforts.Gustad Noble be anything but ; be middle-aged Parsi bank employee Bombay 1970s . film sensitively explore various thing that happen concern his family , his friend and his work , and their effect . same time , be fascinating , and , would assume , accurate , portrayal middle-class , urban life India time.However , be somewhat prepare , have read Rohinton Mistry 's book few year ago . film , as might be expect , can capture all complexity book , but , want read really good book , and see really good film , read and see " such Long Journey " .

why good actress Elizabeth Berkley star commonplace movie ? ? ? ! ! ! cast give good performance ( Elizabeth Berkley Barbie girl , Ele Keats girl mother and Justin Whalin , guy eternally lessen his bother ) , but direction be extremely boring and story be notinteresting and original . can notbelieve movie be produce big screen ! Julie Corman ( producer ) : be crazy ? ? ? ! ! !
My comment be limit generally first season , 1959-60.This superb series be one first be televise color , and be highly influential persuade American have buy color television set , which be about $800 1959 , equivalent more $3,000 today . how many would pay much privilege watch show transmit cathode ray picture tube 17-inch screen ? be eleven when series begin , and watch beginning.Watching now , 50 year later , several thing come mind . first , many story line involve Comstock Lode and heyday silver mining , which date 1859 . 1859 , weapon and clothes be , most part , notauthentic . ( haircut be leave out discussion . ) be basically nitpick.And , would have be impossible Ben have arrive Lake Tahoe area 1839 and have amass 100-square mile ranch next twenty year . pioneer be still try solve Sierra Nevada problem late 1847 , and Gold Rush do noteven begin two year later.Indians be notplay native American actor . John Ford be use native American actor 1920s . Bonanza producer could have easily do so thirty year later . be major nitpick me.There be other time-line problem . Season 1 , Mark Twain appear , and be depict middle-aged man . Mark Twain be 24 years-old 1859 . story also vacillate 1859-1860 ( pre-Civil War ) and what be more suitable 1880 time-frame . there be continuity problem , and over.It be somewhat off-putting , too , there be so much kill first season . time , killing be reduced.Many episode take socially liberal slant , which would be hard believe , give time-line , but give writer credit anticipate seismic shift nation 's attitude begin 1960s.Having say all , acting be good , and have come conclude my latter year Adam 's character be draw well other 's . do n't think Pernell Roberts ever get credit deserve . also , Season 1 reinforce fact Dan Blocker ( Hoss ) be good actor.Many story trace real historical event . guest star be interesting.This be great family entertainment , and series stand up very well measure .
Made French brother Jules and Giddeon Naudet , and narrate Robert De Niro and Firefighter James Hanlon be compelling and heartbreaking tale how New York 's fine shine 's dark day . first see this when be young naive 12 year old , and age still touch . know how serious @card@ really be see expand whole effect 9/11 . be find out who hero be , how there everyday life be compose , and how put their life line situation where most people would just run and save their self . brave man put their life line and watch just increase my admiration . watch can,this be good documentary have personally ever see .
movie think be excellent be suppose be romance little suspense between.Rob Stewart be wonderful actor do n't know why people keep give bad rap . as Mel Harris be great actress and who think look too old Rob be only five years.Rob have lead role his own TV series as well one Scifi channel . be sure remember Topical Heat aka Sweating Bullets and PainKiller Jane.He also star number TV movie and be now make TV Mini series.They need give more lead role that be what be good .
Takashi Miike 's incursion kiddie territory win over almost immediately demonstrate nerve and bravery deal fantasy element . be fairy tale that dare be dark . even kid , think there be something sinister most fairy tale ; horrible thing happen people most child 's book . Miike understand classic tale be bit scary ( and more disturbing ) what appear be first glance . filmmaker take archetypical story kid wondrous quest out preschool classroom . accentuate very real fear world fill never-end hazardous mission . westerner like downplay seriousness bedtime story write specifically kid . appreciate fact Miike be more honest most American filmmaker . go jugular story but also show sign restrain . but self-possessed Miike be still strange most filmmaker . think be great film . highly recommend .
see Arthur TV numerous time laugh so hard Dudley Moore 's role Arthur happy go luck drunken millionaire be hysterical but John Gielgud his servant/ father figure Hobson be equally charming . buy DVD few week ago and watch , passage nearly 27 year be still as enjoyable ever be Liza Minnelli 's role love interest be fascinate chemistry two be magic.Arthur Bach , ( Moore ) be spoiled drunken millionaire who have bar bill that read national debt have desire grow up and enjoy act child . his activity be supervise his dry English butler Hobson ( Gielgud ) appear nobody really care Arthur , Arthur 's father ( Barbour ) offer ultimatum do n't marry dreadful blonde socialite Susan Johnson ( Eikenberry ) four week will cut off his son 's inheritance 750 million dollars.However Arthur meet and fall love Linda Marolla (Minnelli)a young work class waitress and tie thief,now face difficult decision marry love or money . when Hobson die Arthur finally grow up and break off Susan wedding , leave keep both money and his true love.Arthur be truly enchanting romantic comedy everyone
Well , what can say have just watch fantastic film , when my nerve be still jangle ! Jacques Audiard director must be make quite name France , and rightly so . Vince Cassel be Tom Cruise and Emmanuelle Devos be Penelope Cruz either , but two be fantastic actor , and be taut and compelling thriller which start off slowly clever character building and then start put tension tension wonderful climax . other have write plot , so will notsay more everyone film play their role perfection , director , actor , right down cameraman , and everything seem so real , stupid gun play , fighting when happen be so credible , expression , emotion , be almost be there spectator . do favour , get DVD , bottle wine , turn light low , take phone hook and immerse Hitchcockian thriller : )
Moon Child be story two brother and friend try make futuristic , economically-unstable Japan . cunning disaster go wrong , someone new enter young Sho 's life , special friend name Kei . year later have grow rather close , and have find way combine both their talent one unstoppable team . escapade , encounter new friend and his mute sister who become part their band friend . long disaster again strike and group fall apart . alliance turn enemy and their world be all turn upside down . regret and hopelessness claim while power and success take other . tragedy claim still other . truth be reveal and life be forever changed.And will never see more beautiful sunrise.This movie be gripping tale undying friendship , web relationship , and team noteven death can keep apart too long . Moon child combine sci-fi , drama , and action perfect cast and talent create most sensationally move movie time , and great most audience . minimize everyday romance and put more emphasis important value can all relate such friendship , loyalty , and believe . nothing could possibly compare . personally have never see anything quite , and do n't suspect ever will again.It appeal wide population many way and be must see .
generally , be nothuge fan stop-motion film and first Ruka do n't capture my attention . however , know film be make repressive Czechoslovakia Soviet-domination era , more watch film , more realize just how subversive innocent look little film be . subtext really make film come life and give real staying power both work art and political statement.The sad little film be do dialog , but be pretty clear what be happen . cute little wooden man be make clay pot and have lovely time when suddenly meddle animated hand appear and destroy pot--making sculpture hand instead . well , wooden man try again and again chase away hand and do his own thing . however , time hand become more and more insistent and eventually cage man . and , end , man be dead thanks meddle hand and hand , sign real hypocrisy , give man hero 's funeral ! say , film be obvious attempt brave Jir Trnka criticize his domineer government . notsurprisingly , Czech love film and give critical praise , state ( i.e. , hand ) ban little parable . sadly , Trnka do notlive see his nation liberate little more two decade later co-called " Velvet Revolution " .
have never read Shakespeare 's Hamlet watch but do have Shakespeare book and could follow dialogue . my view movie may be partially bias have never read play before , but get pull movie 's grasp . Shakespeare be undoubtedly one good writer ever have live and story Hamlet be definitely one his good achievements.But now movie ... find all actor movie have firm grasp what be say and thus , be able articulate quite well . Leonardo Romeo and Juliet be nothing compare Kenneth Branagh and King . thing like be work very well " Movie " and notplay be study . do n't need be affluent Shakespeare relate all Misery hamlet have go through . would recommend movie wide audience.That be my two cent .
patronage George Lucas , captivating and totally original fantasy " Lumage " ( combination animation live action cut-out ) be about as far remove usual kiddie fare anything make Ralph Bakshi his heyday . brilliantly conceive character such shape-shifting dog Ralph ( one duo bumble , reject hero ) , Synonamess Botch ( hilariously foul-mouthed villain ) and Rod Rescueman ( pompous novice superhero ) breathe life uniquely clever concept : Frivoli vs. Murkwood or , eternal fight dream and nightmare . context , MOR-infused song soundtrack ought nothave work but somehow do . be real pity , therefore , have have watch truly crappy-looking boot ( cull TV screening ) uncensored version there be also mild variant that tone down language its VBS release film be otherwise unavailable DVD . interestingly , Henry Selick and David Fincher work picture subordinate capacity .
Anna ( Ursula Andress ) be bring official R.N. ex-lover Benito Varotto ( Duilio Del Prete ) , ostensibly nurse age widower , Count Leonida Bottacin ( Mario Piso ) , back health heart attack . but Benito be actually lead group heir and businessman , include American entrepreneur Mr. Kitch ( Jack Palance ) , ulterior motive , reflect what Anna hopefully will actually accomplish Count . have history , well , like woman , and would be actually bit more " vulnerable " be cure . bad guy get derail Anna do notgo along and grow closer Count . ending might be say be ironic , but be probably well describe predictable.But so much plot--this film be totally erotic comedy , start finish , and oh how good . there be many nude scene , include one Anna and Jole , one malevolent heiress , play Luciana Paluzzi . Ursula and Luciana be noteworthy continental ex-Bond woman , and thus fulfill fantasy male viewer . do Thunderball ( remember Fiona Volpe ) , Luciana play femme fatale , sort , less elegantly.Perhaps good scene be Anna 's ( slow ) complete strip and jump bed young Adone , " other patient " ( who incredibly be resist ) , attempt find out what know plot . but even point be already two-faced ( good ) , have decide notgo along . however , Benito be more two-timer woman , have have lengthy fling past Anna and Jole , and rival well erotic scene follow invective-filled ( put mildly ) argument and Jole . be standing-up encounter which Luciana be down black panties only . nice one be Ursula swimming fully naked estate 's pool . Count be free , client , put his hand wherever want Ursula , and take advantage . hey , somehow have go back actress ' name my description . Erotic scene involve other woman include amusing naked wine cellar chase . " sensuous nurse " be compact , 77 minute , but do n't need be--it be enjoyable interruption , start finish . definitely recommend .
This be one good movie have ever see . feel greatly touch theme movie intend convey . One sentence that keep come up my mind be " history repeat " . life be what be show movie : when people be young , seem notunderstand their parent , their own spouse ; people have excuse notshare dear time their child too late ; people always have work hard support whole family but be just liable neglect subtle feeling their partner ; people always change their perspective different stage their life ; people can always be forgive their heart be full love their beloved ; nothing be more important blood relation people share world , and be never too late talk their folk what feel bottom their heart so as achieve good understanding , so when life have end day , people should notfeel sorry or regretful have keep their word and there be always hope -- -a new life . actor and actress be fantastic . have understand director 's intention perfectly . movie 's charm lie , , effect bring skillful and splendid fusion cheer and tear audience .
like movie lot . really intrigue how Deanna and Alicia become friend such tragedy . Alicia be just troubled soul and Deanna be so happy just see someone be shoot . my only complaint be beginning be kind slow and take awhile get basis thing . other be great .
have n't laugh hard movie really long time . garbage Hollywood have be put out lately drive up wall ! one be definetely fresh and witty . look demographic figure rating , only few woman have vote ! do n't want ruin movie but be sure guy who see run their computer rate and give poor score , why ? movie put man their place , that be why . more woman vote movie its actual humor value and notbe damage man ... could easily be " 7 " rate movie !
have always enjoy Kenneth Branagh 's version Shakespeare classic , always do very good job , but movie , one who lift whole movie , be none other " the-always-great-actor " Laurence Fishburne . surely have make poor choice film , even be wonderful actor , but one be truly give real Othello : passion , intensity jealousy grow strong Fishburne 's well portray paranoia and , furthermore , be finally give black Othello ! do n't think could have choose good Othello . who else could have give blend sympathy/antipathy , love/hatred and , notforget , fiery eye ... ? Branagh be good always , but nothis peak , Irne Jacob 's Desdemona be fairly good but bit bleak , Laurence Fishburne truly lift and make very interesting and enjoyable movie . do watch .
i love and be so shatter there notmake season ! ! ! i wish would ! be good show ever ! ! ! ! ! ! there be probably notchance decide notcancel show be there ! ha ha i wish there be though ! i would be so so excite ! ! i really would ! miss ! and be especially shatter notknow what happen Jason ! ! i think should make one ... . i also think its silly u have writr ten line post comment. . make your comment drag on..and one will read ! ! i really want know what would have happen jason and nicole ... maybe could make spin off ! !
movie do contradict first one far origin Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins go . wo n't deny . however , look " Part II " separate film , then be very good movie . remember watch early 80 's ( and fit its targeted demographic audience then ) , and absolutely love much more first movie ( notdo n't enjoy too , be just one seem have little something extra ) . sure be dark first one too , but perhaps maybe be why be so good . and be dark deep kind subtle way too ( kid may notfully understand , but could still be bit scare atmosphere give off , and adult watching will surely get quicker have now watch film again now my mid-twenties ) where basically have young girl make deal evil spirit/demon exchange something else . get picture ? but simply watch child , sure say may have be little scary , but nothing traumatize . fact anything give fantasy game could play when be age . ca n't tell number time use pretend Dark Heart want imprison , have help capture Care Bears , try make turn over his dark side , and other thing etc. movie be also good my imagination . and be also get great emotional depth too . use watch least week.Also Hadley Kay be perfect choice voice Dark Heart ( always think so and always will).Now be just too bad never make soundtrack available . sometimes just want hear grow up watch movie , as good is."What good be love and care ca n't save ? "

feel Monarch Cove be one well write and act " Drama " series come network long time . show have great potential and could n't wait view week . could be develop great Primetime Soap . people look forward type act be be " reality TV " overkilled . long type write and act show Dallas , Knots ' Landing , Dynasty , Melrose Place , etc. provide . Monarch Cove update concept quite well and anticipate only get well . there be so much expand character and be very interesting and captivating their own right . would be loss notexplore and develop character have draw and hook their world . absolutely love show be mysterious , interesting and sensuous go overboard or offend . love .
least something good come out Damon Runyon 's misguided attempt sentimentalize Mafia . " guy and Dolls , " seemingly indestructible stage musical , be capture film 1955 Joseph L. Mankiewicz ( " Eve " ) colorful , enjoyable movie that feature all-star cast include Vivian Blaine ( original Broadway show ) , Jean Simmons ( whose character bear odd resemblance Audrey Hepburn " Roman Holiday " ) and two all-time great lead man , Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando , whom have recently win Oscar Best support Actor ( " here Eternity " ) and Best Actor ( " Waterfront " ) and be top their game . listen Brando singing " Luck Be Lady Tonight " speak volume about where early Dylan get his voice . stubby Kaye steal show Nicely Nicely Johnson , who bring down house " sit be rock Boat . " ubiquitous Sheldon Leonard add yet page his rogue 's gallery screen gangster . film have bright , cartoonish look , anticipate Pop Art early 1960s . character speak stylize patois , apparently base Yiddish idiom . film 's social attitude and gender role be date , be great fun , and even gentle kid Salvation Army be harmless and reflect real animosity organized religion . just see Sinatra and Brando same film be reason enough watch movie , but have lot other attraction offer its 149 minute .
Richard Attenborough be director whose name be synonymous Academy Award win ' Gandhi ' , back ' 83 . do n't know other work his till i recently come across ' Cry Freedom ' , release back 1987 . may nothave be as popular his Gandhi , be bit gripping , notmore , and be release when South Africa still have notget rid shackle apartheid . most movie social issue come out event have happen , i guess one release time.The story be base real life character and event . book which movie be base , be write Donald Woods ( Kevin Kline ) , journalist who use work South Africa end seventy . trace origin Woods friendship charismatic black leader Steve Biko , who be wonderfully portray Denzel Washington . can imagine good choice role . Washington exude natural charm and screen presence , which Biko 's character required.While initially , Woods be what feel be black racism be spread Biko , meet man , could nothelp be draw his struggle and idea . bond grow strong , and Woods and his family realise and become more sensitive plight people Biko represents.However , finally , tragedy strike , and Woods must now concentrate escape South Africa , his book , so can get publish and let outside world know what be go on . second half movie be gripping tale his escape South Africa , along his family , and will keep tenterhooks.There be deliciously humorous dialogue too . scene Biko and lawyer courtroom be example.Lawyer : do advocate violence ? Biko : advocate confrontation . lawyer : well , be n't violence , Mr. Biko ? Biko : notnecessarily . and be have confrontation now , but i do n't see violence.However , there be moment that bring back horror that pervade country good sense prevail . scene where army open fire protest school child be gut wrenching and heartbreaking.This be definitely must watch . would suggest notfamiliar Attenborough 's work , do take time out . there be movie which make lot money . and there be movie which make life . would day prefer latter .
see film once again appear infinitely superior time previous time have view . acting be stunningly wonderful . character be very clearly draw . Brad Pitt be simply superb errant son who rebel . other actor and actress be equally fine respect .

influence Hal Hartley Adrienne Shelly 's " will take there " be notovert , but clearly have tie his work ( Shelly have act two Hartley 's film ) . notonly do her film exhibit very tight narrative , but hyper-stylized and extreme character strangely render human emotion very real light . film be notironic whole ( thank God ) , small and subtle irony that pepper piece allude bitter truth love and loss . beautiful cinematography and soundtrack straight seventy , " will see there " be great indie-film that do n't stoop postmodern irony when deal woe love and reality human emotion.The film begin Bill 's life fall piece . notonly have sell his good friend Ray beautiful country home , but his wife Rose have leave order join Ray retreat . wash up , Bill wallow his own gloom and doom his sister Lucy ( play director Adrienne Shelly ) bring kind surprise : self-help book and " date " her traumatize brother.The unwilling Bill try refuse , but sudden appearance Bernice his door leave choice . doubt Bernice 's initially superficial demeanor and ridiculous hairstyle detract his ability " rebound " . however , her pseudo-hippie quality annoy so much lash their first date . and Bernice be so traumatize his derogatory remark attach , force . what end , be notaware ... maybe fact be psycho . ( and who better play psycho Ally Sheedy ? )Aware Bill desperately want see Rose , Bernice offer her car , but condition take her somewhere first . way , proceed hold Bill prisoner his own gun ( Pinkerton Detective , no less ) . imbroglio angst , resentment , redemption , passion and violence ensue Bill and Bernice find their way country home Ray and Rose ... course , few stop way .
First off , consider film be nearly fifty year old ! yet , still stand up one great film time . wonder how many today throwaway celluloid production will still be talk about 2050 ? story be simple , yet solid enough and effect be nothing short phenomenal day . can still recall first time watch , kid , when monster enter force-field protect ship and get see its outline first ( and only ) time . have shiver fear , can tell . look dated today , but still more effective enough.The scene tiger show their age now . can see outline where tiger be mat shot Altaira , but be only just visible.Likewise , effect whereby creature melt its way Krell door be wonderfully done.It be also amazing see Leslie Nielsen ( good remember Airplane and Naked Gun movie ) young , but still mature man . be 30 when film come out ! nearly 80 now ! all all good movie that be sure continue be favourite year come . timeless .

have see Deliverance , movie Pulp Fiction do n't seem so extreme . maybe today 's blood and bullet standard do n't seem so edgy , but think be 1972 and movie have truly sinister core then make think differently.When start watch movie nothing really seem unusual get " Dueling Banjos " scene . scene brutality and edge film be truly visible . watch Drew(Ronny Cox,Robocop)go head head seemingly retarted young boy really show how edgy movie can get . when think kid have small banjo , which could probably make hand , compare Drew 's nice expensive guitar , really figure out just how out their territory four man are.As plot go be very believable and never stretch its limit . but what really distinguish film , about four business man who get more bargain canoe trip , be director John Boorman(Excalibur) break all character away plain caricature or stereotype . so movie go full horror and suspense really care four man and what would happen them.The acting be universally excellent . Jon Voight(Midnight Cowboy , enemy state ) and Burt Reynolds(Boogie Nights , Striptease ) lead great cast . Jon Voight do probably hard thing film and that be make his transformation family man warrior very believable . Reynolds whose character be warrior start , Voight 's character transform course movie . Ned Beatty(Life) be also good extremely hard role , come get rape hillbilly , Ronny Cox turn believable performance.One thing that really make movie powerful be villain be as terrifying have ever see .

why panic never get good theatrical release be easily see : be much too smart , and audience would have probably have difficult time , compare American beauty its probe midlife crisis , and Sopranos and Analyze be study illegal goings-on family life . panic may seem derive unoriginal material , Brommel 's lifelike character couple deft dialogue and observant direction make film realistic look undoing middle age man.William H. Macy star Alex , hitman who work his father 's ( Sutherland ) contract-killing business . lead double life , his wife ( Ullman ) and son unaware his real trade . his middle-age , become increasingly disgusted what have do all his life . his calm , collect facade stir repressed resentment his father 's controlling grasp his life . when meet young woman(Campbell) feel invigored and decide be time quit family business.The fact writer/director Henry Brommel decide make profession his main character be try break away contract-killing be disposable . could have easily substitute undesirable profession ; his character be so well-develop and believable , scene handle so smoothly and realisticly and dialogue write so insightfully and naturally focus fall Macy 's conflict character rather his job hitman . Brommel 's script feel Shakespearean tragedy , definite theme destiny run throughout.In Alex , Macy create tragic , easily sympathetic character , and turn yet brood , great performance , as can always be expect . Donald Sutherland be also effectively abrasive and abusive his overbearing father , and Ullman 's dramatic turn Macy 's wife be welcome change comedian . consider scene bicycle shop , where her mood subtly darken and peak affect scene emotional confusion.Henry Brommel 's first feature , panic be film that be well-crafted its sincerity . first-rate cast , plausible script , terse dialogue , and nice direction , character-study be hopefully just taste Brommel 's aptness create character that seem real.8 out 10

excellent series , narrate Laurence Olivier , brilliantly , should be say , chart beginning end World War 2 . origin be notentirely examine fully Germany 's fall hand Versailles treaty which help propel Hitler 's demonic rise , but as one reviewer say , that must be hard do , 26-part series so much cram in.Apart expect combat photography/action , there be plenty personal , emotional and human tragedy that be tell give viewer amazing insight , especially be notnecessarily World War 2 buff/fan . episode showing ' testimony ' and what life be like home front main allies/adversary , Britain , Germany , Japan , Russia and U.S.A. be quite eye-opening . show extreme savagery war frontline and course suffering civilian , death camp etc. , be very well handle and expose . will fully recommend history class young generation ( which could be say be one 47 ! ).Certain thing be quite strangely leave out , advent new jet era beginning , Frank Whittle 's experimental Gloster jet and Gloster Meteor 's combat debut well as German Messerschmitt Me 262 - especially V-1 be see make its debut and there be surprisingly small mention V2 . be probably small oversight , notrefer more sensational secret and fantastic weapon which WW2 bring forward more barren old science . but great series that make its mark and have do so ever when thankfully repeated.A series own box set history term , DVD anyone especially who happen be military fan . Jeremy Isaac and Thames TV should be well proud .

want learn something Spanish Civil War and about all political detail and intrigue , let tell , have choose wrong film.This be vision war happen Majorca , small island coast Spain . when war happen small island that take position traitor almost once , there be war open . soldier be send front fight , mainland , kind war happen home , small island . there , neighbour tell other neighbour , sometimes their political view be contrary new regime , but many people be tell on old family fight , or maybe silent introvert who have friend be tell someone who want " earn point " . and thing do n't happen open . there be trial , true , but many other time people would just be wake up middle night , take out their home close cemetery where would be kill . and next morning body would be find , and people would have idea what have happen , but nobody would dare speak or do anything . be nottalk soldier kill someone have never see their life . be talk people kill their neighbour , and probably say hello their widow next day , and even attend funeral guy have kill . be talk village one or two thousand inhabitant , where everybody know everybody.I be small island and have hear story my grandparent tell , and must say film upset , oh yes , do ; but also find remarkably beautiful and move . initial violence be notsomething director or writer make up , that be how thing happen war . kid know his mate 's dad be fascist squad that kill his dad ? completely possible . that happen late ? possible too . TB be real too . time my island be notholiday resort have become . people be poor , illiterate , and work small farm . war there be time hardship.So , wo n't find war story film , or least notkind war story expect . there be battlefield , soldier , political intrigue . be mean kind war , which happen when space be limited ( just check size island ) , when neighbour fight their neighbour , when member same family fight other , and live place where everybody know everybody . will find story damage particular kind war can cause people and story how survive damage , or maybe don't.I must mention excellent work do writer who adapt novel and all actor , who manage sound really Majorcan . be remarkable .

Nanette may have be dearly love her son but their father be different story.Philip Seymour Hoffman prove once more why be one most impressive actor Hollywood today portray Andy notonly greedy criminal lack morality but also , contradictory way , man can sympathize . Ethan Hawke also bring Hank alive notjust loser but really man just desperate hang what little have leave . Andy and Hank be thus bring life such realistic way be easy think as notjust character but very real image lose and confuse man who now find face consequence their actions.Before Devil Knows be Dead be moral tale how our action lead consequence otherwise might notexpect face . more , our choice also can affect way never expect . what should have be good picture year , see how life be easily break when love money become ultimate pursuit order ease our troubled life . other word , there be easy fix or answer our problem and try find can only make thing worse.positive
Beat path important documentary that look attractive feature . forbidden Lie$(2007) be simply good ( cinematic ) version Norma Khouri 's book Forbidden Love , and THAT be best-seller . onion-peeling literary fraud and pretty woman , Lie$ be very good editorialise reality TV.Cleverly edit and colourful , Broinowski 's storytelling be chapter move silhouette Norma Khouri meaningfully blow smoke . disagree ( Variety ) be overlong ; instead my one slight problem be episodic nature its key player comment other ' just-recorded testimonial . single watch your sense narrative become mired ... ..so watch twice.This Oscar-worthy effort be once genuinely funny , upset , and totally engross document one lie . apparent con unfold Australian state Queensland very personal swindle Khouri 's friend and fans( ! ) . clearly friend be now " turn " , funny on-camera line belong Khouri 's QLD neighbour Rachel Richardson who speak her disillusionment flat , no-nonsense colloquialism : " think be load sh ! T.

Khouri be nevertheless very pretty and smart 35yr-old rather disarm charm , and surprisingly , worked-out biceps.Gradually be introduce less-and-less-adulating Aussie journo , publisher and fan who first buy extent Khouri 's honour-killing accusation hook , line and sinker . later see their more rueful reaction , quite self-controlled and matter-of-fact , perhaps little bitter.It be Jordanian (anti-)honour-killing activist who take deep umbrage Khouri 's fallacy its pot-stirring force reduce pace change . Honour-killings do happen Jordan ; be just their prevalence that be odd Khouri 's book--plus 72 other " fact " . 2003 activist fax ( Australian ) Random House 73 painstakingly-checked objections.The publish house 4 continent who have jump chance publish first-time author Khouri never try check fact . leave corroborration disclaimer their author contract , too be fair game . massive hot-topic fraud be as easy perpetrate world type up Internet cafes.Later still be shock discover " factual error " extend Khouri 's bio well . one thing , be notonly not35yr-old virgin ( her defence be merely do n't disabuse people their assumption ) , but have slickster husband and 2 teenager ! sometimes be just too fast-talking her American accent . also seem too-comfortable cellphone technology and Western clothes . realise observation might sound prejudicial very Jordanian woman who do n't need Western paternalism , but when even cultural cue do n't jibe addition Khouri 's " fact " , have get start question your source.At point filmmaker come same conclusion . make admirable effort hold Khouri account , person , Jordan . last third be consume fact-finding trip back Amman , where one " fact " fall . eventually Broinowski force her (con)"Artist " admit decade-discrepancy her story , and be that Khouri record her derisive secret confession her own digital camera . secret , Khouri 's " American security guard " Jeremy be hear have Australian accent : be actor !

last - have finally get round and manage see " clean " copy Pakeezah ! up now have only have mangle scratchy jerky version tape Dubai TV sometime ' 90 be , quirky English subtitle , dizzying widescreen coverage and fluid colour mind its own . have think world such poor ( and short ) copy find decent one be well worth wait and full 140 minute even more pleasure think possible.This be lovely Meena Kumari 's film start finish , and believe be plan 1958 on , finally realise 1971 . what shame be chronic alcoholism finally kill soon afterwards , and fact be too ill perform scene Pakeezah , necessitate body double . scene strain definitely show her face.The story Purity versus Adversity can only treat fiction have experience anything remotely close , but be lead understand faithfully depict world now go that must have be common one time India . be sparkling and colourful film simple relentless epic message , intense romantic tragedy which be somehow simultaneously feelgood too . but be peerless golden music Ghulam Mohammed as sing incomparable Lata Mangeshkar - especially Thare Rahiyo - and its part unfold story that make film so outstanding . have seldom hear such serious , beautiful , poetic , wondrously sing and play song movie soundtrack . Singin ' Rain may be my favourite musical film but Pakeezah have my favourite music - yet Lata say song mean nothing special . only pity be also unique Mohammed Rafi only have one song here , classic duet Lata.Because all but notblind its fault , Pakeezah be my favourite Indian movie , film time when westernisation India be gather pace and watch now when Western value seem be state sponsor and de rigueur . very least watch Pakeezah taste what Indian " pop " music have offer world be all jettison drum machine , Bollywood Beat and bhangra .
This be one well animated family film time . moreover , virtually all serious rival title come same creative mind Hiyao Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli . specifically , other great film include " my Neighbor Totoro " and " Kikki 's delivery service . " spirited Away be quite good , but bit too creepy typical family fare - good teenager and adult . one thing that set " Laputa : castle sky " apart other film Miyazaki be be far more tension-filled adventure ride.Why be film so good ? be complete package : animation be very well do , and story be truly engaging and compelling.Most Japanese anime be imaginative , but decidedly dark or cynical or violent ; and animation be often jerky , stylize , and juvenile . none problem plague Castle sky . have imagination burn , and character be well draw , slightly exaggerated version realistic people . ( none trench-coat wear poser ) there be plenty adventure , but notblood and gore . animation be smooth , detailed , and cinematic ally compose - notlot flat shot . background be wonderful.The voice act dub English version be first rate , particularly two lead , Pazo ( James Van der Beek ) and Sheeta ( Anna Paquin ) . sound engineering be great , too . use your studio sound , have get it.One aspect particularly enjoy be much back story be left unexplained . Laputa be once inhabit , and be now abandon . why ? never know . know as much need know , and then just have accept rest , which be easy do invent world be so fully realize . indeed , be fair say world be more fully realize most minor character , who be most part one-dimensional stock character ( e.g. , gruff general , silly sidekick , kooky old miner , etc. ) Highly recommend people age 6 60 !

Aiden Quinn be quite good McCartney , also bear striking resemblance Macca , do occasionally trip his Scouse accent.This work fiction be well-write and well-directed . be pure fantasy , course , but sometimes feel voyeur peek keyhole reunion . rooftop scene be especially move , McCartney tell Lennon what have never hear child--that be worthy and important , and could never be his fault be abandon his parent . also enjoy scene park where pair dance absolute abandon reggae band ! my one complaint would be : be notsure John be as caustic be portray film stage his life . have settle his domestic situation quite nicely , and be actually know be quite friendly when approach fan . only few year later , be very friendly when be first approach his assassin autograph day be murdered.Mostly film serve stir up feeling again what might have be have John live bit longer . be quite sure Beatles would have come back together stage . and be quite certain Lennon and McCartney would still be friend today.Well do , VH1 . will watch again and again .

John Singleton 's fine film , blockbuster wannabees Shaft remake , be thought-provoking movie overall great acting and superb balance story 3 main character , identifiable youngster problems.What like most be also cover problem selfpity young black , problem mostly ignore medium and other film who mostly focus social-economical problem and racism white . movie show black can be equally ignorant and racist.The masterful thing film be deal so many topic get shallow . be notjust racism , but about how hard can be adopt new world ( college ) , date rape , discover sexuality and isolation . Omar Epps , Michael Rapaport and Kristy Swanson deliver fine performance , and support cast be equally interesting Jennifer Connelly lez ( yay ) and Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes college bum cause little riots.The only negative be caricature professor Laurence Fishburne ( " Peppermint ? " ) . surely , plenty professor be nutty . but be notas flat . skinhead be also bit caricature , but guess be like too real life.Overall great underrate piece filmwork , like American history X will love one.8,5 out 10
' The Luzhin Defence ' be good film fine central performance , but too much novel and notenough filmmaker 's craft shine through . feel through most film character just help push narrative along . Marlene Gorris could perhaps have examine psyche Luzhin , rather depict tortured innocent victim tear apart cruel motive others.Adapting literature screen be clearly difficult task , especially novel write early 20th century . film do notgo deeply enough relationship Luzhin and Natalia . Natalia 's rift her mother come churlish disagreement mother rather dramatic flashpoint film . feel be put Luzhin 's torment and eventual tragic end , be give pleasure have his unusual and complex personality unravel . however , be moving and enjoyable film but certainly notgreat one .
Steven Spielberg ( 24 ) have already direct two superb episode 1971 series call " Psychiatrist " , star Roy Thinnes . One episode have be emotionally trouble 12-year old boy and other be about vibrant young man ( Clu Gulager his good performance ) who be die cancer . episode be stunning , visually anything else TV , and emotionally complex and adult . creator " psychiatrist " be Richard Levinson and William Link , who create " Columbo " and also produce its first season.Peter Falk insist first rank , experienced TV director first season " Columbo " , Bernard Kowalski and Jack Smight . but Falk agree Spielberg watch part Clu Gulagher episode " Psychiatrist".Spielberg say DVD " Duel " love Steven Bochco 's " Murder book " script ( base Levinson/Link story ) , and try make production look million dollar feature , even think have lot less money work with.This episode " Columbo " be far more visually stylish and make good use sound track and background music almost other " Columbo " episode , even series always use top director . Spielberg manage keep great Falk and Cassidy ham up too much , but actor be still lot fun . Spielberg also get fine support work Martin Milner , Rosemary Forsyth and Barbara Colby . all performance have freshness and vitality . only " Columbo " episode that be close be as well direct be " By Dawn 's Early Light " episode Patrick McGoohan ( direct Harvey Hart).I think two episode " psychiatrist " and episode " Columbo " suggest Spielberg have n't develop technically all much director . be great beginning . " Combat ! " DVD commentary 1962 episode guest star Albert Salmi , Robert Altman say episode be pretty much as good ever get director . maybe same be true Spielberg .

Bell , Book and Candle be one great pop culture phenomenon mid-twentieth century , very similar phenoms see today ( back 70 be - more ten year later - there be still endless reference film ) . make Novak huge star , put nice item Jack Lemon 's resume , cast new light Jimmy Stewart , and give Lancaster and Gingold new avenue explore their career ( both go on continue play witch and other curious " old bat " , film and television).Along 40s movie Married Witch ( which help make Veronica Lake icon ) , Bell , Book and Candle inspire grand film and TV fascination thing witchy that begin Bewitched and have continue Practical Magic , Worst Witch and Harry Potter.What rarely see noted be movie be also rather interesting alternative Xmas movie . story take place Christmas holiday , and , fact be superficially witchcraft , actually embody great deal Xmas spirit ( give , love , family , self-sacrifice , etc).I will always watch movie ( have see several time my first viewing early 90 's ) particularly be show around or just holiday season . have style , substance , great cast , and terrific production value . and Adam 's Rib , casually express idea that be rather radical its time , be radical even now ( movie female character be guileless and powerful ) , and so always seem ahead time .

what could have be see coup sexual " revolution " ( purposefully use quotation word ) , Jean Eustache write and direct Mother and Whore poetic , damn critique who ca n't seem get enough love . there be message film- and will hope message would come only fact what else Ben-Hur length feature have offer- be order love , honestly , there have be level happiness , real truth . be possible have two lover ? can try , but what be outcome one can really have what really want , or feel can even express say what want ? what be truth relationship that Alexandre ( Jean-Pierre Leaud ) have woman ? be twenty-something pseudo-intellectual , notseeming job and live off woman , Marie ( Bernadette Lafont ) slightly old and be usually , notalways , his lover , his last possible love-of-his-life leave , and then right away pick up woman see street , Veronika ( Franoise Lebrun ) , who perhaps remind . soon what unfold be most subtly torrid love triangle ever put film , where psychological string be pull cruel word and slight gesture . first think might be what will happen Alexandre , but be mistake . woman be so essential question love and sex have be around , talk and , something sink in.We be tell part sexual revolution , theory notentirely practice ( perhaps be , ca n't say have notbe alive period see first-hand ) , be freedom lead lack inhibition . but Eustache 's point , notentirely message , be be practically impossible have way : ca n't have people love and expect get satisfaction ultimate companionship that arrive " f***ing " , character refer and again.The Mother and Whore 's strength as far have theme be express dread promiscuity , lack monogamy , also stimulate intellect talky talk have ever see movie . same time see character Alexandre , who probably love hear talk be about movie see or something bad his past , Eustache make so film be n't pretentious- could appear be- but be about pretentiousness , what lie who be cover up their internal flaw , what need use when be ultimately alone morning.If think film Sunrise/Sunset be talky relationship flick , have n't meet . but Eustache revel dialog character have , sometimes trivial , or ' deep ' , or sexual , or frank , or occasionally extremely ( or subdued manner ) emotional , be never , ever uninterest or bore . contrary , who ca n't get enough *good* talky film , be exceptional . his style do n't call out audaciousness that come his forerunner nouvelle vague dozen year beforehand , Eustache 's new-wave touch be character , and then reverberate them.This be realism spike attitude , thing time scathing and sarcastic , crude and shame expression . three actor be so glue their character ca n't ever perceive ' fake ' emotion or go melodrama . be almost Too good naturalistic/realism term , but Eustache 's material there be other way . luckily Leaud deliver crown chip his career period , and lady , particularly Labrun " whore " Veronika ( claim staggeringly refute film 's climax sort one unbroken shot ) . and , touch , so often , director will dip quiet moment thought , character sit , listen record , and contemplation or quiet agony . be probably big influence Jim Jarmusch , who dedicate his film broken flower Eustache and have one scene particular that be lift completely ( and lovingly ) approach late Parisian.Sad say , see Broken Flowers , never hear Eustache or film , and procure have become quite challenge ( notavailable US DVD , and VBS so rare take many month track various library ) . notminute time be waste ; Mother and Whore be truly beautiful work , one good French relationship dramas , maybe even just one most staggeringly lucid have see country general . be complex , be sweet , be cold , be absorb , and be very long , perhaps too long . be also satisfy kind level will compare Scenes Marriage ; true revelation human condition continue arise 35 year film 's release .

" Apprentice " refer winner who will win salaried position , learn art high stake deal-making master , and , presumably , gain prime corporate connection . position be dream-come-true want make more money GNP foreign country . entice candidate , Trump show off his private jet , his private luxury apartment replete statue and artwork , his limo , his connection celebrity , and other aspect life billionaire magnate.The road success be noteasy . group be divide two team that compete other . have corporate-sounding name , such Versacorps and Protg Corporation . team be assign task that entail entrepreneurial venture such create advertising , sell merchandise , or negotiate . team select project manager who provide leadership and organizational skill complete task . win , manager receive lot credit , particularly eye final arbiter . lose , manager may also become scape-goat . task be monumentally difficult only day or two complete . task may involve create TV commercial , or print ad . other may involve sell retail outlet or street.The task bring out good and bad participant . often show immediately who be most reliable , who be most trustworthy , and who be hard work . and task also expose who be notgood team player , who be inefficient , and who seem only out . task invariably reveal unexpected way strength and weakness participant and particular project manager . how well manager communicate team , delegate work , organize time , and set specific goal will largely determine outcome , but do notnecessarily predict winner.The single-most tell aspect someone 's potential be when or be assign project manager . their real ability as oppose their self-propagated ability immediately show veneer that can be hide $100 silk tie or beautiful makeover . leadership quality and/or weakness often become agonizingly obvious only few minute . promote top-notch leader be notalways as strong when put real-life leadership situation . be always easy " toot your own horn " actually engage leadership . project manager , even winning team , often do notformulate cohesive strategy . often believe dive off deep end complete task first minute rather take little time organize and discuss how task will be complete be more efficient . more often not, member ill-strategized team be run around headless chicken figure out go along , and long run end up waste far more time.The win team get taste high life , such eat dinner exclusive restaurant , fly private jet , and/or meet celebrity . lose team come dreaded board room where Trump hear lame excuse member and knock off one or more contestant piece chess board now infamous " be fire " . often , project manager be hold partially responsible team 's loss , and may be target Trump 's accusatory rhetoric . week , least one person become casualty lose team.My least-favorite aspect " Apprentice " be board room . task bring out strength and weakness candidate , board room often bring out bad . unfortunately , rule game insist there be one win team and one losing team , even competition be close . member lose team start accuse other , often ruthlessly , who be fault . and sometimes more one person get fire . seldom see under-performing candidate take responsibility their action board room . Kristi Frank and Kwame Jackson be possibly only candidate who take full responsibility her team 's loss and receive recognition selfless act . , Kristi Frank and Kwame Jackson have most integrity all candidate . however , Trump see Kristi weak and fire , claim be n't stand up , which may mean value ego more integrity . one should sacrifice their integrity . Kristi Frank may nothave become apprentice but can live know do notblame other unjustly . be n't worth as much " win " ? strength " Apprentice " be also its weakness . team performance be evaluate strictly winner and loser , other evaluation opportunity be overlook . bar huge gap win and lose team , sometimes lose team exemplify high standard teamwork and efficiency . have see lose team sometimes appear well organize winning team . Americans be so often obsess win and lose often overlook excellence .
record , be notaffiliate production way.Hidden Frontier be probably Star Trek fan film most episode produce date . 7 season ( be last ) have produce 50 or so episodes.This be mean feat almost budget and everyone volunteer their time and energy.By their own admission , early season do nothave as good production quality late one but as progress effect , green screen work and act improve.I do find difficult " dip " so start beginning and watch all way through . HF benefit story arc just all good sci fi and dovetail nicely Star Trek universe which be set . character and " relative " original series have be bring story and add lot feel story , sometimes improve character original.The whole experience include excellent web site , blooper reel , high membership forum which be frequent many actor and production staff and weekly chat.If be look high definition , high budget production , be probably notyou.If be look continued adventure Star Trek universe story that do Star Trek credit and make think , be one .

someone who remember Jane Daily Mirror strip cartoon , view film be exercise nostalgia . context be wonderful , but young viewer would undoubtedly find comedy limp and would miss point actor be cartoon character . plotline be also bit limp today 's audience , but reflect naivety 40s and 50s very well . Jane , must remember , be part escapist fantasy wartime year , create boost morale troop . give double meaning " strip " strip cartoon.The story have something common tale Edgar Rice Burroughs and Rider Haggard . theme would have be familiar one reader era , bunch bumble Nazi thwart few equally bumble Englander , and set African jungle course.For Jane fan , must see . rest , damp squib .
what love on-screen adaptation Stone Angel be stay so true novel ! great film ! avid reader , find bad thing film adaptation be book somehow get lose translation . can tell Stone Angel team be careful notlet happen film.Ellen Burstyn be excellent casting choice role Hagar and be definitely movie superstar . however , think Canadian actress ( Christine Horne ) choose play Hagar her young year also do incredible job that warrant great praise . have n't see Horne 's previous work but will definitely seek out see her Stone Angel performance.I hear Canadian theatrical release Stone Angel be go happen Spring or Summer 2008 . ca n't wait see big screen again !
This be one very few movie there which be very erotic be pornographic , there be only very rudimentary plot . there be notmuch live sound or dialogue ; instead , actor do voice-over describe their experience , why participate , etc.It be document.It 's mind-blowing.I can totally understand why nobody else ever try do something . there already be something . . :-)NB : producer do n't have right distribute DVD version . have also never see be sell anywhere ; may email Mr. Boerner and order copy VBS .
title overstate content movie somewhat , which might lead unrealized expectation . frankly speak , there be very little " panic street " be see here . fact , movie very few people actually know there be murderer loose who may well be spread plague everyone and anyone encounter . have say , what do have here be very well do story level suspense that start out reasonably high anyway ( , people " street " , viewer know what be go ) and director Elia Kazan build very deliberately . plague-infected killer be seek , one more interesting sidebars find be develop relationship Dr. Reed ( Richard Widmark ) and Police Captain Warren ( Paul Douglas ) . beginning , two really do n't like other , even have work together . end , have forge real bond respect other . Kazan do good job that.Pretty much all performance here be excellent . Widmark and Douglas be great , and be quite take very early look Jack Palance playing what would become his typical " heavy " role . find very little criticize here . perhaps Barbara Bel Geddes come across little bit flat Reed 's wife Nancy , but her role be n't really central story . , excellent piece work . positive

Jack Frost be about serial killer who be sentence death . way his death sentence prison truck ride collide chemical tanker fill chemical that turn his molecule snow ground turn snowman . be killer that would turn killer snowman . Jack now want revenge sheriff who catch .

can be as simple and primitive my evaluation as simply say " like " ? be reasonably funny bit , get great star and be gorgeous look . song ( there be about two which be then repeat ) be forgettable , but get healthy ironic treatment ( such terribly handsome Mr Fairbanks explode frenzied Wagnerian version tender ballad Miss Grable have just render ) ; there be n't much dancing all 1861 crinoline drape Miss Grable , and comedy might be bit heavy hand , but result still be very uplift . photography ( include real outdoor shot which be thrill ) be amazing , play around different shade lush heavy gold . Miss Grable be bit her prime and plumpish side , but still fresh and comfortable continental " olde worlde " comedy . be pretty much line " Down Earth " Rita Hayworth , and tend be rather dislike many . so suppose several people would deem " Lady Ermine " be outdated and stuffy . but be fairy tale , and tend move along certain paste anyhow . my suggestion be - just enjoy artwork , costume , witty script and everything else film have offer , and stop complain . film have be release DVD Germany , German and English soundtrack .
i say domino principle be enormously underappreciated film.anyone who have take time investigate our contemporary history conspiracy ; jfk , rfk , mlk,g.wallace and fact numerous other can only draw conclusion author domino principle really know what be talk about.roy tucker could be lee harvey oswald or james earl ray or sirhan sirhan or arthur bremer maybe even john hinkley or timothy mcveigh.to mention few.the conspiracy scenario involve spy , big business and political assassination be notreally fiction but ominous part our convoluted existential history.god help us,but domino principle be more fact fantasy.if cause little loss sleep , maybe should.do n't take my word it,investigate .

 This- and notcertain slightly overrate Southern Soap Opera-was great epic come out Hollywood great year , 1939.I will notnot restate obvious-Cary Grant,Victor McLaglen( who WAS Bengal Lancer ) , and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. give superb comic performances.However , want note two other , less understand element masterpiece .

many people judge fan service film lot super star star movie ( Gackt , Hyde , and Wang Lee Hom be very famous singer Japan ) . but do n't judge watch , be what say . Gackt and staff be very serious when make film , and work so hard . be good film touchy story inside . several scene can be fun and other be so sad . make so good ca n't stop watch all again.The story have write pretty well but admit their act be little disappointing . be especially Hyde his skill acting be other and be weird hear way when speak other language his native language ( Japan ) . but , be comprehensibility be their first time act movie.I think Gackt try show how someone can be so weak when lose most important person their life . when Toshi be kill , when Sho ask Kei turn Yi-Che being vampire wo n't let her die , when Sho 's Brother die , Kei Shoot Son die , and good and beautiful scene be when Sho pass away~ even tell Hyde 's skill be still weird but give two thump up scene ! !There be time where plot go too fast do n't tell reason why Son can join local mafia and be Sho 's enemy be good friend past and also Son be Sho 's brother law.Whatever , love movie~ ( very much ^^).This be action movie touching beautiful story .

Viking appear here brute antagonist , equivalent North Seas plunder Hun and Mongol further East . film 's narrative- -- which function more parable- -- center conflict Brendan , who seek create beauty his illumination time encroach darkness , and his stern Uncle Abbot -- who seek protect town Kells and his nephew loom wall barrier Norsemen . Abbot disregard value Brendan 's art his quest security . be movie 's outer conflict . Brendan 's inner conflict be find hidden eye creative illumination which will allow complete most difficult painting book Kells . eye be guard Dragon Ouroboros , who destroy notsuit quest as surely Viking will kill ( be as much story will divulge ! )What really like film be its creator ' imaginative understanding great art work survive West 1200 year ago . character be stylize flat abstract shape define line just as original book Kells . ( particularly noteworthy be monk Aidan 's pet cat , define few line , yet purely- -- and even magically metamorphically feline . ) range emotion which Brendan and other animated character convey give their economy abstract design be tribute excellent artistry director and his animator . decorative border edge picture change complement dramatic impact give scene , and characteristic illumination dark age be bring wondrous animated life Secret Kells . course , historical drama usually tell more our own time time which dramas endeavor depict . however , introduce archetypal element story , writer and director Secret Kells convey numinous sense lived-life far-off time Ireland which feel psychologically true , however much script might stray pedantic historical fact . ( United Nations ' band illuminator who appear rogue ' club artist Secret Kells be n't historically probable , but be all well-design , individuated character who do much convey universal appeal quintessentially Irish story . ) Animation have always seem good vehicle well help understand visual art different time and culture . magnificent art direction movie clearly derive its historical visual source , but have also be cleverly adapt demand animated storytelling ; animation have exist Dark Ages , Secret Kells be what would look ! finally , Brendan 's hero be quest film be artist 's perennial quest convey spirit beauty , life and inspiration . ( be preachy or even particularly Christian , movie affirm Jesus ' dictum " man do notlive bread alone . " ) my estimation most inspired movie creative process visual artist be Andrei Tarkovsky 's Andrei RUBLEV , film great Russian icon painter 15th century . Secret Kells express much same sense mystery and exhilaration artist 's visual quest and creative process . be certainly notas profound Andrei RUBLEV , but- -- heck- -- its cartoon ! ( and one which will appeal young and old alike . ) think movie will hold up well repeated viewing : its own modest life-affirming way , stylize Secret Kells be classic .

One most underrate movie have see long time , Bill & Ted 's Bogus Journey be second hilarious adventure Bill S. Preston Esq. and Ted Theodore Logan , aka Wyld Stallyns . there be two way look film : first , see dumb dialogue , far fetch plot , juvenile idea . OR. . see brilliantly downplay idiot who yet again find situation too big their brain . throw Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzeneggar plot and become big blockbuster movie . Bill and Ted go story same level sincerity , only be Bill and Ted . be tricky fence balance , but when watch movie notthrowaway screwball comedy , but adventure feature two guy who have business be adventure , become so much more .
there be story ( possibly apocryphal ) exchange Bruce Willis and Terry Gilliam start Twelve monkey . Gilliam ( allegedly ) produce long list ( think aircraft one Fifth Element ) and hand Butch Bruce . be entitle " thing Bruce Willis do when act " . end simple message say : " please do n't do above my movie".There be fact movie ( definitely true ) . Gilliam do n't have hand writing.I would contend two factor play huge role create extraordinary ( notcommercial ) success that be Twelve Monkeys.Visually , Twelve Monkeys be all have rightly come expect Gilliam film . be also full Gilliamesque surrealism and general ( but magnificent ) strangeness . Gilliam delight wrong-foot his audience . ending Twelve monkey will surprise one who have sit first real , Gilliam borrow heavily Kafka clockwork , bureaucratic relentless movement character their fate . be journey , and character development undergo , which unsettles.I love Gilliam film ( Brazil , particular ) . but do all tend suffer same weakness . seem have so many idea , and so much enthusiasm , his film almost invariably end up tangled mess ( Brazil , particular ) . still maintain Brazil be Gilliam 's tour de force , but there be no deny Twelve Monkey 's be breath fresh air tight-plotting department . style , substance and form seem merge way notusually see ex-Python.Whatever truth rumour above , Gilliam also manage get first rate ( and very atypical ) performance out bald one . Bruce be excellent film , as be all cast , particularly suitably bonkers - and very scary - Brad Pitt.It have be decade film be release . when watch again , realise have n't really age . have change , course . and make look film fresh eye . seem be fitting tribute film , partly least , be reflection mirror , altered perspective and absurd one-way journey time all make . first rate film . positive .
Billy Wilder be co-credited story , and his unsentimental touch be noticeable quite original tale ghostwrite songwriter who work burnt-out music legend Oliver Courtney . obvious misunderstanding be get out way quite quickly , thank heaven , and what remain be witty and breezy concoction fine song ( and more forgettable one ) , Crosby his most charming , great turn Broadway legend Mary Martin and Basil Rathbone and Oscar Levant provide most cynical barb ( Levant be rare form and his quip have n't date ) . delightful surprise , and recommend fan genre .
viewer who come long its making , " Winchester ' 73 " have something common " Casablanca . " watch , get feeling be look string clichs encounter so often genre ; then realise clichs become clichs only be copy particular film , and be so widely copy film be so great . other word , be seminal work."Winchester ' 73 " be joy watch . broad line plot be somewhat predictable , but mostly have see copy so many time late movie , and nevertheless still contain number twist which surprise . dialogue , pace and Mann 's direction be excellent . Stewart shine particular , and be fan be " must-see , " but be notalone deliver good performance . remarkably , many most thoughtful and/or witty line go minor character . make character ( much ) more cardboard cutout , lend additional realism film.This be remarkably underrate film , and well worth keep eye out . DVD also contain interview Stewart which provide background film .
truly enjoy film . act be terrific as be plot . Jeff Combs have more talent be recognize . only part flick would change be ending . death creature be far too gruesome Sci Fi Channel.There be interesting religious message film . Jeff Combs obviously play Messiah figure and creature ( or shark prefer ) represent anti-Chirst . there be particularly frightening scene that have ' end world feel ' . only notice my third viewing classic creature feature . know many people wo n't get reference Christianity , but watch close will get .
My former Cambridge contemporary Simon Heffer , today writer and journalist , have put forward theory , just British film-makers eighty be often critical what call " Thatcher 's Britain " , Ealing comedy be intend satire " Attlee 's Britain " , Britain which have come be Labour victory 1945 general election . theory be presumably notintend apply , say , " Kind Hearts and Coronets " ( which be , anything , satire Edwardian upper class ) or " Ladykillers " or " Lavender Hill Mob " , both which may contain satire but be notpolitical nature . can , however , be apply most other film series , especially " Passport Pimlico".Pimlico be , or least be forty , predominantly working-class district London , set North Bank Thames mile Victoria station . be notquite correct say , as have often be say , film be Pimlico " declare independent " Britain . what happen be ancient charter come light prove fifteenth century area be cede King Edward IV Duchy Burgundy . mean , technically , Pimlico be independent state , and have be nearly five hundred year , irrespective wish its inhabitant . government promise pass special act Parliament rectify anomaly , but Act receive Royal Assent area remain United Kingdom and British law do notapply.Because Pimlico be notsubject British law , landlord local pub be free open whatever hour choose and local shopkeeper can sell whatever please whomever please , unhindered ration law . when other trader start move area sell their good street , British authority be horrify what regard legalise black-marketeering and seal off area try and force " Burgundian " , people Pimlico have rename , surrender.Many Ealing comedy have as their central theme idea little man take system , either individual as happen " man White Suit " or " Lavender Hill Mob " , or part large community as happen " Whisky galore " or " Titfield Thunderbolt " . central theme " Passport " be ordinary man and woman take bureaucracy and government-imposed regulation which seem be increasingly important feature life Britain forty . film 's particular target be ration system . war system have be accept most people necessary sacrifice fight Nazism , but become increasingly politically controversial when government try retain peacetime . be major factor grow unpopularity Attlee administration which have be elect large majority 1945 , and organisation such British Housewives ' League be set up campaign abolition ration . can agree reviewer who state main target film 's satire be " spiv " ( black marketeer ) , who play relatively minor part action , or Housewives ' League , who do notappear . satire be very much target bureaucrat , who be portray either have " rule rule ' sake " mentality or desire pass buck and avoid have take action all.I suspect film be be make today would have different ending Pimlico remain independent British version Monaco or San Marino . ( indeed , suspect that today concept would probably serve basis TV sitcom rather film ) . 1949 , however , four year end war , film-makers be keen stress patriotism and British identity , so film end Pimlico be reabsorbed Britain . One best-known line film be " always be English and always will be English and be just be English be stick up our right be Burgundian " . there be sharp contrast rather heartless attitude officialdom common sense , tolerance and good humour Cockneys Pimlico , which be present be quintessentially British characteristics.Most action take place summer drought and sweltering heatwave , but last scene , Pimlico have rejoin UK temperature drop and start pour rain . global warming may have alter thing slightly , but many year part be British be ability hold belief , whatever statistic might say contrary , that Britain have abnormally wet climate . ability make joke climate be equally important.There be good performance Stanley Holloway Arthur Pemberton , grocer and small-time local politician who become Prime Minister free Pimlico , and amusing cameo Margaret Rutherford batty history professor . main , however , be , appropriately enough film small community pull together , example ensemble act real star performance but everyone make contribution excellent film . lack ill-will and rancour more recent satirical film , but its wit and satire be no less effective all . remain one funny satire bureaucracy ever make and , possible exception " Kind Hearts and Coronets " be my personal favourite Ealing comedy . positive

Melvyn Douglas play wry amusement perfection well , never hit single wrong note.One my favourite scene have definitely get be when Bill get lock ' store room ' , and Jim go ' save ' ... only get everyone trap inside ! little problem that pop up Blandings renovation project--including petty jealousy and ad campaign ' Wham'--seems bring together everything *could* go wrong build new house but make believable and enjoyable watch . positive

what platoon G.I. 's Japanese army be be send back time 400 year right middle feudal war that lead formation Tokugawa shogunate ? great pitch right ? movie do exactly what say tin.Thankfully writer do n't bother explain , usually ridiculous sci-fi movie , scientific mumbo jumbo time transport . no how be or why be . just do . however time transport sequence be trippy hell and quite beautiful , notbit date . notas silly would imagine.The rest movie follow premise T. but lose bit steam various subplot that follow G.I.s arrival medieval Japan , pick up devastating battle sequence . undoubtedly be main order day . whole concept and extension movie , be probably originate simple pitch : what G.I. 's equip late modern warfare be fight samurai ? and boy do deliver.The main battle sequence that span more half hour be probably one good its kind 70 's action/war movie . notonly be relentless and exhausting pace and length , be also terrific mish-mash style and technique only unique premise G.I. Samurai can deliver . mean , where else would get chance feature tank , ninjas complete shuriikens , helicopter and samurai same shot ? G.I. platoon lead lieutenant Iba tear literally hundred extra , gun down machine gun , mortar , grenade and tanks.This mish-mash style be one foot firmly root sprawling jidai-geki epic Kurosawa 's Kagemusha or Hiroshi Inagaki 's Samurai Banners , other be western action and war movie . there be stylistic touch ( wonderful slow-motion shot and bloody violence ) that bring Sam Peckinpah or Enzo G. Castellari Keoma mind . Japanese cinema have always be influence western and other Hollywood work and vice versa , and G.I. Samurai effortlessly turn east-meets-west melting pot exciting film.The film-makers thankfully take whole thing seriously and movie benefit immensely . nottongue-in-cheek mentality be completely absent , be just do n't try pander so-bad-it's-good audience that enjoy laugh their movie . budget be probably hefty , be evident hundred extra , elaborate costume ( very decent production that be nottraditional jidai-geki ) and special effect . camera-work and edit be top notch , almost good movie high artistic ambition deserves.It 's notwithouts its flaw either course . there be " song " scene , where sort 70 's Japanese rock , disco and country song play over montage ( there be bond scene , love-interest scene , " war be hell " scene etc ) . song be pretty lame and corny and detract whole thing . clock whooping 140 minute , fly bullet most part . still scene , flashback and subplot first half could have be clip tight effect.The cast also deserve mention , feature such prominent name Sonny Chiba , Isao Natsuyagi ( Goyokin , Samurai Wolf ) , Tsunehiko Watase ( yakuza Papers ) and Hiroyuki Sanada , hit right note .
Visual creative epic inimitable style.This film may neither have most alternative dramaturgy nor most artistic acting . but who dare say film be art ? be notsupporter idea , important film must be serious , non-commercial or bother question . even there be lot film , apposite attribute , that like.Bogus Journey , sure , be notone film . what get be pure , excessive creativity very positive charged , childlike energy . film do n't reflect reality . its friendly-naive and utopian . imagine world future describe Rufus - would be pretty nice time-place combination live ! music ; - )Technically , Bogus Jorney be very well make . always like cinematography and scenery movie . especially point Bogus Journey top its prequel far . also effect be good , and think most very make cgi . generally prefer good old effect big budget movie . sure its ' just Hollywood movie ' out people view . but think be very charismatic way.A short word soundtrack : all band and orchestral music fit very well film . also sound design have lack . be notbig fan rock music , but have get track Winger scene ' station ' build bill and ted robot van . love unorthodox camera work its beginning.Let conclude say this:This film be very naive and very imaginative ! be way good Panzerkreuzer Potemkin , Godfather , Eraserhead or Aguirre - wrath god . be absolutely superior citizen kane , apocalypse now or chris marker soleil ... ... be even good Total Recall ... way ! ? yes way ! Bill and Ted 's Bogus Journey be simply good movie ever made.Who dare disagree make guilty " artsie-fartsy behavior " or like Terminator Salvation ( what be big self-defamation)PS : part 1 be notgood movie . Bogus Jorney be superior sequel . noteven Terminator 2 be superior sequel ! its not!

comparison Sleuth , early stage-play-turned-film , be obvious and my first viewing too think Sleuth be good , but Deathtrap have , least , more repeat viewing Sleuth.I purchase Deathrap bargain bin Wal-Mart , figure have Caine and underrate Reeve and be worth 6 buck . be one fine DVD purchase could have pick up.It be one best-kept-secrets movie buff always be always delight discover . and be totally worth repeat viewings.Though Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine turn bravado performance Sleuth , be doubly impress Christopher Reeve Clifford Anderson . Reeve , rightfully associate his now legendary portrayal Superman , steal show what should have be Oscar worthy performance . have always feel Reeve be type-cast actor who do n't get much chance shine outside Superman film and few other flawed but entertaining film Somewhere Time , but film show his potential be truly tap and put use , thank goodness.I absolutely relish Michael Caine 's performance . be glib , deliciously manipulative and sadistic . and watch work Reeve and Dyan Cannon be absolute pleasure . fact , be thanks movie get " Michael Caine phase " and start rent as much his stuff humanly possible.As Deathtrap , there be enough juicy dialogue here fill up its " memorable quote " section . ( unfortunately , much dialogue would inherently spoil immensely entertaining plot).It be really , really hard talk movie spoil important plot point that be infinitely more fun discover your own . needless say , be must-see . but , be great and most rewarding blind purchase time.Repeat viewing be must.And deserve sit Sleuth your DVD shelf.I will leave beautifully write quote film : " wonder would n't be ... well ... just trifle starry-eyed enter such risky and exciting collaboration ... where could count sense moral obligation ... whatsoever . "

Lisa be hotel manager or owner and get flight Miami . end up sit next assassin name Jackson who tell have switch room family or her father die . reason have switch room be Jackson want blow up.It be great suspense movie Lisa try several way escape ploy Jackson have set up . whole storyline be great and think could have spend more time plane . there could have more plane but other , whole movie be pretty good.I especially like ending be heart-stopping . do n't know what be go happen and be surprise . , movie just take off .

Gil Bellows portrait prison man be notalways perfect but be very entertaining . Shaun Parkes portrait Bellows prison mate Clinique be great and extremely powerful . downside think will put Esai Morales portrait Markie.Take my advice and watch movie , either will love or dislike !

The Bourne Ultimatum ( 2007 ) Review : thrilling set two , get final installment . here be my take:The Bourne Ultimatum have all . have Jason Bourne(Matt Damon ) coattail one who know everything . have be run too long . time , ends.The Bourne Ultimatum have great plot , awesome writing , fantastic direction , suspense , and good action summer . Matt Damon deliver possibly his good performance date . have conviction and swell desire troubled assassin.There be intelligent humor here and fine suspense . reaction certain event will have laughing(in good way ) or cheer on . ( or ) hear lot intelligent laughter theater and lot clap . audience be loving it.The Bourne Ultimatum deliver nicely gift-wrapped package . good and then some . be , my opinion good movie summer.The last Word : excellent conclusion . good trilogy . be how summer movie thriller should be do . love Bourne trilogy .
My , Kasi Lemmings certainly be fair look woman . film be lost gem , dead-on satire " mockumentary " early 90 's Hip Hop scene , when MC Hammer have just begin fade away good night . follow three member NWH embark their picaresque journey would-be rich and fame . and Nickolas Nickleby , end , finish their journey notfar where start , but least little wise and lot less naive . be one good film one have ever hear , but be kind film either love or hate , lot " company man " regard . regard movie 1000 island upstate New York : be wonderful little secret want keep .
very addictive series.I have notsee exact combination drama , action , suspense and Sci-fi never before . be impress chapter . screenplay be very intelligent , i do n't know how creator invent all amazing story , character have strange past , trouble , stormy relationship , give show human sense need create intimate characters.The most incredible be fact all character be relate : number , have meet before know , and so . other , enigmatic security system and Darma initiative be element that do n't let lose chapter.Mr . JJ Abrams , what do think create amazing story ?
" Dressed Kill " be surely one good horror/thriller movie ever made.It 's taut,stylish and extremely suspenseful mixture sex and violence.The acting be pretty good,the orchestral score Pino Donaggio be unforgettable and there be plenty surprise keep thriller fan intrigued."Dressed Kill " be murder mystery that involve sexually frustrate housewife(Angie Dickinson),her teenage son(Keith Gordon),her psychoanalyst(Michael Caine),and high price call girl(Nancy Allen).The murderer film be transsexual name Bobbi who be also one Caine 's patients.The film be full breathtaking moments:the infamous elevator murder scene be extremely stylish and pretty gory well.Highly recommend .
be big fan Martial Arts movie , but video shop be nearly empty and Jet Li be Lethal Weapon 4 and get free when other film have rent , way rent . absolutely love , my flatmate and ( 22 year old Biochemistry and Accountancy student ) spend half hour film make strange Kung Fu noise and throw beermat shurikens other . ca n't explain ( well maybe little tequila ) . never enjoy Bruce Lee , skinny bloke kick big bloke , beat , kick big bloke etc film end . think Jackie Chan little less comedy and more action .
Let 's eliminate discussion use non-Asian actor play Asian role . movie be 67 year old . 1937 studio chief believe actor could/should be able play role . actor be contract , and do notalways have choice what role play . end story.This be truly great epic story love , individual right , class stratum , and men/women issue . centerpiece film be two brilliant performance Luise Rainer and Paul Muni.Muni play Wang , Chinese farmer , who be about take wife ( Rainer ) . start , treat respect , time when woman be look as little more hire help . give too much movie away , go high and low relationship , and even story may take place late 19th/early 20th century,the story and much their feeling , seem credible.Other fact movie be about 5-10 minute longer need be , and performance Charley Grapewin and Walter Connolly be typical 1930 's cartoon character , be really wonderful movie that , unfortunately , have become victim political correctness.9 10
be never big fan horror movie . usually try cheap trick scare their audience loud noise and creepy child . usually lack originality and contain overact galore . only horror movie i be Stir Echoes Kevin Bacon . be well-act , and have great story . but have be join and maybe even surpass Stanley Kubrick 's The Shining , quite possibly scary movie ever.The movie follow writer ( Jack Nicholson ) and his family who agree watch hotel be close winter . there be rumor place be haunt and last resident go crazy and murder his family . but Jack be convince will be OK and can use quiet overcome his writer 's block . month solitude and silence however , Jack become grumpy and later violent . be cabin fever or be there something hotel that be drive mad ? One creepy part movie be feeling isolation Kubrick make . hotel be very silent , and room be huge , yet always empty . be also eerily calm when Jack 's son be ride his bike barren hallway . Jack Nicholson 's performance be also one his very good , scare hell out and make sure get out once awhile . my favorite scene be when be talk ghost walk-in refrigerator.The shine be tops horror movie my opinion , beat snot out crap Ring and Blair Witch Project . may be oldie , but be definitely goodie . positive
Sure may notbe classic but be one full classic line . One few movie my friend and quote all time and be fifteen year later ( maybe be Cinemax one too many time ! ) Michael Keaton be actually bad actor movie--he ca n't seem figure out how play -- but be surround fantastic cast who know exactly how play spoof . look movie cheer up ? be but rent friends--it will make even well .

folk who produce masterful film have do fine service novel that stand perhaps good fiction work center human guilt and human responsibility ever publish . Nolte take role Howard W. Campbell , Jr. , and make his own , remain true Vonnegut 's depiction man who have lose ALL ( and ) Love.No weakness fine adaptation .
This could be difficult people get , be use Hollywood production style . directing be uninspired , apparently simply film stage set-up , and audio quality be bad here and there ( rustle people 's clothes occasionally compete their voice , etc.).My friend and start watch know what expect , and first scene almost put off . seem very stagy and cheesy . then pick up tone content , and really start enjoy ourselves.It be very funny , corniness . definitely give chance appreciate great dialog . also , Helena Bonham Carter be adorable , course .
The Secret Kells be one most unique , beautiful , and eye- pop animated film have ever see . watch film , be convince nothing could give up run its money and be shoo-in win category , but find Kells serious contender.The secret Kells tell story young orphan name Brendan , who live his uncle , Abbot Kell . Abbot be loving guardian , but perhaps bit too strict and much more concerned fortify wall town come attack Viking be nurture boy 's imagination . when legendary Brother Aidan ( who look surprisingly Willie Nelson ) show up and take boy his wing , Brendan go journey wood and meet lovely forest nymph name Aisling who take liking ( and save his life more once ) .

see movie week ago and still keep think . be very move movie . find character very believable and likable almost fault . as real life sometimes people disappoint , as be case Leo , who even like his character could nothave be more disappoint when be willing have unprotected sex even though fully aware his HIV status . be also disappoint Leo reject medicine available , and awful way treat Marcel when decide ship back home train . think movie show very real way why HIV number be up young gay man . be way mean bash gay ( be gay ) and movie very well could have be make young straight person who make bad choice and seem unaware consequence and other . only part movie could n't understand be why ( gay friendly ) family be unwilling include Marcel Leo 's illness point notallow go funeral.I think big message movie be gay or straight be do notHave UNPROTECTED SEX !
other , have see and study most book and film concern Clutter Killings , include few dramatic work thematically base action and psycho-mythology participant crime -- include Capote . as Capote , can forgive willfully withhold Perry Smith 's confession , intimacy and writing even defense counsel . believe truth and fact Capote " reserved " his " book , " which require Capote two guilty verdict and capital punishment , would almost certainly have sustain successful insanity defense Perry Smith even old McNaughton Rule . Capote could never write major literary work " Cold Blood . " shame and guilt . my opinion , willingly encourage and plan brutal capital punishment provide spectacular ending require his book/drama . , both man Had die his book succeed . book have justify pretend be about horror capital punishment . his action and silence assure ice-cold conclusion.Capote 's book be nottruth . be notfactual or journalistic . be drama and melodrama spice his own creatively psychotic imagination . what most people consider virtue contemporaneous first movie be stark image Capote 's mind , which may have be most cold-blooded aspect . wonder viewer ironically but necessarily prefer Blake 's performance . actor be nightmare Capote 's dishonest imaginings.So who be say how two killer should be play ? who be judge what could make essentially poetic psychotic snap excessive courtesy and kindness " do now " kill ? agree few who see Eric Roberts ' work magnificent performance , Shakespearean its range , yet play heartbreaking sincerity . Anthony Edwards take much safe " attitude mode " create smarmy Hickok ; but be one-dimensional and boring , only few note his television range . Roberts be almost four-dimensional , add physical weakness and agony powerful animal body , Frankenstein creature who think poetry and know exactly what notdo . Leopold apropos Loeb , Robert 's Perry Smith be hopelessly love evil man . Hickok or man his particularity , Perry Smith would nothave bring his psychotic mind world horror . fear more fear anything else life.Given freedom Capote 's death grip consciousness Clutter killing , Roberts and Edwards be free create original personality and psychosis craft different and new production drama . same fact , same line case record , but deep , more complex , clearly titanic psychotic stress -- indeed Roberts be so good fluidic madness physically and facially demonstrate moment how little awareness have where or who is.What many our reviewer dislike film , Roberts particular , be cold-blooded killing be n't show way expect and have be manipulate demand . be here be see far more profoundly realistic " interpretation life and death " Capote could ever create -- real Tragedy.The actual cold-blooded killer , Mr. Capote , and his hypocritically artistic " non-fiction novel " do notcontrol interpretation and performances.If " Cold Blood " and Capote 's effect life , literature and truth matter as much scholar say , then take gut as well talent portray truth , or version truth , that be notrank , cowardly lie draw up fathom Capote 's own abyss .
have idea what movie be read L.A. Weekly . generally agree review LA Weekly and decide get ticket film . film star molly parker ( my favorite television show Deadwood ) and Lukas haas -- who suspect will be see more very near future . film be funny , heartwarming , feature great acting , and beautiful photography . i do n't know film have distribution , but hope do - or will - soon . be destine be real indie gem . even have music my favorite band silver jew ! only disappointment be molly parker be n't there screening . even there ... be hand good film i see festival .
One good ( notgood ) Stephen King 's screenings . dark dark can be , surprising non-hollywood end , terrifying atmosphere , amazing book adaptation , outstanding cast , educational ( do n't play afterlife ) , short - everything excellent horror should be ... my favorite horror movie , straight 10+ .
today have never see film . its be film set Old Dark House and Frankenstein and concern small Bavarian village where supposedly giant bat be suck blood villagers.Frankly its damn good movie that have atmosphere spare and cast that wo n't quit , Lionel Atwill , Dwight Frye , Faye Wray and Melvin Douglas play character name Brettschnieder which be interest that be my great grandmother 's maiden name.This be carefully modulate film that have suspense and witty one liner that slowly build its brief run time , only go astray when about ten minute end realize have limit time wrap everything up . point end its straight run finish very little fun that precede it.Leonard Maltin and IMDb list run time 71 minute and warn short print . trouble be IMDb and Maltin can be wrong , and case think be source trust more say full run time be 67 minute ( Overlook Film Encyclopedia ) Quibbling know be insane but most print that be available tend run 60-63 minute amount miss material be considerably less its only 67 minute long . personally think wo n't matter much its most five minute and doubt very much will make or break film.What ever run time , like creaky old film , do , mean do , watch movie , its great dark and stormy night film .
documentary be incredibly thought-provoking , bring life two long-time lover who be final stage AIDS . past footage their twenty-some-odd year together really bring their final moment home.If movie do n't make feel pain and agony two fascinating people , do n't have heart .
do n't think most people give movie much credit deserve . love low budget horror movie and take cake , especially originality . yes Scarecrow be Kung-Fu fighting frightner , but why not? one else be willing go far . really have n't have much fun watch movie Candyman . town pick one kid call scarecrow , even his mom do n't care . then get kill and spirit be infuse Scarecrow , who then go Killing spree . his demise be relatively easy assume movie get go . dedication end go straight bunch horror director , but most dedication Dario Argento really strike cool , folk who wanna make movie new genre . movie have lot Arnold rip off , one liner will definitely laugh stick around and kill sheriff stick . would say , grab pizza friend laugh your A$$ off movie . love its originality , most fun .
find film first time when be search work witch Stphane Rideau have participate , still extraordinary ravishment cause astonishingly beautiful Les roseaux sauvages ( Portuguese , Juncos Silvestres ) , Andr Tchin . be search similar movie , come age line . find then Presque Rien , movie where director Sbastien Lifshitz deliciously amaze , earn nomination Cannes festival 2000 . story be about two guy , kind boy next door , Mathieu ( Jrmie Elkam ) and Cdric ( Stphane Rideau ) , who meet summer vacation . land far where live , Mathieu spend be day beach his sister . there meet Cdric , local , whom start estival and revealing relationship , much mean sensual and seducer personality Stphane Rideau give his character , ( Les roseaux sauvages , 6 year young , still preserve innocence sweet seducer , witch mature here experience ) . exemplar directing , amorous sequence , intimate and confess description that be make boy first face his ( still ambiguous ) sexuality and great love . first love , its terrible progression ecstasy-despair . good film be good France : fervent passion , hot and excited rationalism , brownish beauty , simple and natural acceptance make family , notsurprise and first anger . still , there be beach , luminosity , lightness e simplicity summer , freshness breeze , surge&#8217 ; S melody , and expressive eye introvert Elkam ( hesitant , hurt , puzzle , passionate ) . sex be notavoid nor exploit , be treat be , exhibitionist intention . virtue pure talent , be work drama uncommon quality , cheap sentimentalism , show inevitably real image two homosexual their prime youth ordinary person , social fear rejection and shame . be well worthy be see , especially who adore French movie ( DVD front cover be very lame , two actor ten star , grease brilliantine ) . movie witch , my opinion , deserve 8-9 !
* ! !- spoiler - ! !*Before begin , let say have have both advantage see movie big screen and have see " Authorized Version " movie , remake Stephen King , , 1997.Both advantage make appreciate version " Shining , " all more.Also , let say have read Mr. King 's book , " Shining " many occasion year , and love book and be huge fan his work , Stanley Kubrick be retell story be far more compelling ... and SCARY.Kubrick really know how convey terror psyche straight film . direction movie and writing screenplay , , acquire title " Magus " question . Kubrick 's genius be magic . movie world lose great director when die 1999 . his other outstanding credit be : eye Wide Shut , 1999 ; Full Metal Jacket , 1987 ; Barry Lyndon , 1975 ; Clockwork Orange , 1971 ; 2001 : Space Odyssey , 1968 ; Spartacus , 1960 and many more.The Torrences ( Jack , Wendy his wife and Danny , their son ) be live Overlook Hotel winter ; Jack have be hire caretaker . be his job oversee upkeep hotel several month hard snow , spring when Overlook reopen its door . seem there be many wealthy and jaded tourist who will flock Colorado Mountains snow-filled summer getaway.The Hotel be impressive piece architecture and staging . lend atmosphere , have dark , yet same time " welcome " atmosphere , . furnishing and furniture be period ( late 70 be - early 80 be ) , and filmography landscape approach hotel opening scene be brilliant . notonly let enjoy approach overlook , also fix your mind how desert and isolate hotel be rest world.The introduction Wendy and Danny 's character be stroke genius . get whole story their past , Danny 's " imaginary friend , " Tony , and story Jack 's alcoholism all roll nice , neat introductory scene . there be need stretch past history over two hour movie ; obviously , Kubrick see beginning.Closing day . again , scenic drive mountain Hotel ( time , family tow ) , interaction Jack and Danny be hilarious also portray very disturbing exchange.The initial tour Overlook be quite breathtaking , even " staff " be move thing out , get chance see majestic fire place , high cathedral ceiling and expensive furnishing , dormants and crown molding architecture . " do good job ! pink and gold be my favorite color . " ( Wendy Torrence ) even " staff wing " be well design and beautifully built.The maze be magnificent touch , reminiscent Labyrinth which Minotaur Crete be Guardian . when Jack Nicholson stand scale model maze and stare center , see Wendy and Danny enter , be magickal moment ; one that tell right away , there be heavy energy house ; there be something seriously wrong , already start . " would n't want go there have least hour find my way out . " ( Hotel Manager)Scatman Cruthers , Dick Halloran , be genuine and open his performance . his smile be natural and his performance be wonderful . could actually believe be there hotel , take tour kitchen Wendy and " Doc . " his explanation " shine " Danny be very well deliver , as be his conversation child Tony and Hotel . be believable and sincere.The cut out and pan scan hotel , mountain loom behind , cold air swirl about , mist come up warm roof snowbound hotel , add Much atmosphere movie . also mark " half-way-to-hell " point , so speak ; turn point movie.Shelley Duvall 's portrayal Wendy Torrence be masterful . ( what also play Olive Oyl ? ! just show her marvelous diversity ! ) Honestly , see movie big screen 1980 , say , " what ? Olive Oyl ? *lol* ( Popeye be also release 1980 . ) but take back as soon movie start . be brilliant . Fiend 's opinion , be her good performance , date ! ( do love Steve Martin 's " Roxanne , " 1987.)Once Kubrick have establish pearly bit information which , viewer , need be possession : Torrence 's past ; Danny 's break arm ; Tony ; history hotel ; fact Danny be not" mental , " but rather clairvoyant instead , and general layout Hotel ; which get opening 3 sequence ; movie never stop scare you.The two butcher daughter previous caretaker , Delbert Grady ( girl have appear several time Danny , first way Tony apartment family ever leave hotel ) be icon which Danny could identify , and which be afraid , same time . be haunt ( and haunt ) , and show Danny how and where be kill , rather graphic and material way.Kubrick 's Tony be write attendant spirit , spirit guide which acquire result his arm nearly be wrench off his body his own father . be ... " little boy who live my mouth . " would manifest end Danny 's finger and physically speak Danny order speak To Danny . notbook , realize , where Tony be intend Stephen King be projection Danny old boy , try save his father . Kubrick leave out little twist and somehow make more frightening when Tony " take ... Danny ... . " idea Danny 's old self project back his young self be n't ... scary.The " Woman Shower " scene , do Lia Beldan ( whom can find other credit have do anything before , or ) young woman and Billie Gibson ( who ALSO appear suffer lack credit work or ) , be seductively obnoxious and thoroughly disgusting . be dramatic , and frightening . abhorrent and scary . when Nicholson look mirror and see her decompose flesh his hand ; look sheer terror his face be so complete and REAL.Jack quickly embark his trek " jonesing " alcoholic certifiable insane person . degradation his character 's mental state be carefully and thoroughly document Kubrick . Jack 's instant friendship Lloyd Bartender ( only alcoholic , would-be mental patient and drug addict do ) portray his press need atmosphere which Lloyd avail ; namely , alcohol ... " hair dog that bite . " ( Jack Torrence ) Jack 's case , be bourbon rock , charge Jack . " order house . " ( Lloyd Bartender ) Nice play words.When Wendy find be Jack 's " screenplay " be nothing more page page same line type over and over , 8 or 9 different creative style ... when ask shadow , " how do ? " and Wendy whirl and scream baseball bat her hand ... be so poignant . be point where realize how mess up whole situation be ... how mess Jack be . be very scary , dramatic and deliver strong presence . couple Danny 's vision hotel lobby fill blood , impose scene Jack and Wendy , and confrontational ending scene , make possibly strong scene movie.The " REDRUM " scene . wow . what do say ? what mother would notbe totally freak awaken find their young , troubled son stand huge knife , talk freaky little voice , exclaim " REDRUM " and ? even Had meaning , would still be as scary 7th level HELL . be something everyone could ( and have ) remember(ed ) . speak memorable scene ... Nicholson 's final assault his family axe be perhaps one scary scene movie history . his ad-lib line , " Heeeeere 's Johnny ! " be stroke brilliance and be one most memorable scene history horror . also go down horror movie history.The ending. . ? Kubrick 's ending be perfection . feel end beautifully . smarm , platitudinous whine , tearfully idiotic ending This movie . just epitomize perfection . be will say subject ending.Who care what be take out ? ! look what Kubrick put . rent , watch , BUY . be classic horror genre , and good reason . RAWKS ! !*Me be Me* ... take movie , and sitck your Stephen King collection , and take 1997 " authorized " version do King and stick down kiddie section . be where belong . . : movie rate 9.98 Fiend : .

my favorite Laurel and Hardy film have very , very little plot . instead , give rather mundane situation and just let be hilarious ! film such HELP Mates and BUSY BODIES be funny see boy work or clean house . here DIRTY Work , most film be akin other two films--Stan and Ollie be chimney sweep and spend most film try ( quite unsuccessfully ) clean crazy professor 's chimney . Seeing Ollie fall chimney , boy make house total mess and insane behavior Stanley work together make very pleasing film.However , odd twist , there be also really weird subplot that begin and end movie . seem professor be truly mad scientist and be work formula make thing young . late film , see make duck duckling and even duckling egg ! give then leave boy alone room , be surprise what happen next ? subplot be unnecessary , work well enough . what work exceptionally well be middle portion . give boy nothing exciting do and will be amaze hilarious result . One team 's good film and almost earn 9 .

This be very dark and intriguing horror type thriller base idea religious murder . storyline centre derange man who live Texas , US who suddenly go kill spree his two young son be instruct God redeem world bad people.Bill Paxton who direct movie play derange Father who be know Hand God Killer Matthew McConaughey play his fine performance date old son , Fenton Meiks . film revolve Fenton who decide can no longer hold burden his murderous childhood alone and use flashback hauntingly tell story FBI Agent Wesley Doyle ( play Powers Boothe).I can think many movie that literally keep viewer chain their seat start finish and be definitely one . even want stop watch , wont be able sheer power movie.The director have film movie very well , and help set plot good scenery . acting movie be great but there be drawback be part be very powerful and may disturb people.Whilst concept film be very dark , young child help portray idea brilliant acting . really be spine tingly movie and be guarantee have edge your seat . would highly recommend movie anyone who enjoy horror , disturbing and powerful movie or anyone who just want see something different.positive
This be start new and interesting Star Trek series . have " down earth"-kind feel dark and less " plaggy " scenography.The character need more time develop but have potential . One thing that be fairly disappointing ( Star Trek sery really ) be portray such gloomy picture equality man and woman future when paint very positive picture everything else . ( Earth have stop war , famine etc)The female character here be two , subcommander T'Pol who be vulcan and communications officer Hoshi who be human . Hoshi be quite wimpy and T'Pol be make be " vulcan babe".Some crew attitude feel bit too American ( as oppose more international feel TNG-crew ) but create interesting dynamics.A very good pilot very good series .
generally like something light and fun , so film should n't have appeal . but grab start . story family 's choice and challenge seem obvious , but raise question over and over : " what be my family ? my choice ? " cry and laugh when do really feel what people involve feel . be place difficult watch , but more difficult turn away . story be true , and life be sometimes difficult watch ! show what film-makers can do sex , violence , or special effect : good story be good story all . good and most unpredictable story be all true one . real life , really do n't know what will happen next , or why people do thing that do !
Okay , know does'nt project India good light . but overall theme movie be notIndia , be Shakti . power warlord , and power mother . relationship Nandini and her husband and son swallow up their warmth . then thing go terribly wrong . interaction Nandini and her father law - power their dysfunctional relationship - and life change be strength movie . Shah Rukh Khan 's performance seem be mere cameo compare believable desperation Karisma Kapoor . be easy get catch up love , violence and redemption life film , and find heave sigh relief and sadness climax . musical interlude be strength , believable and well do .
Full House come when be about 9 . remember see re-runs America 's Funniest Home Videos Bob Saget , and one day my mom tell be also show call Full House . One day , be lucky enough catch episode visit family . do n't seem too interesting first , but watch more and more , ever night 9:00 , would just be so it.This show really make want be there , hang out girl , go place , and maybe even join their little family " sing-alongs".The thing most Full House be be great show kid and adult age . there will be part that be more adult , then part that be mean kid , so whole family will enjoy . matter how cheesy can be , be still great show , and would definitely recommend anyone.positive
be so entertain insightful documentary , and wait good while come pipe ( my local video chain ) , and be worth wait . like good documentary / special interest piece , but be definitely heartfelt , honest , and nostalgic , will , look back adolescent life . imagination child be fascinating , and be where great story begin . rent or buy like good , humorous , and around entertaining documentary . Mr. Stein and company have definitely come long way neighborhood Video CamCorder production bank hold-up , and gay-rings that turn people gay one glance . all seem rather successful be respectful field , and be good know be all still good friend .

must admit have my doubt movie be go watch . main reason that be be compare Hitchcock movie . have see several movie that be say be inspire Hitchcock or that could have be make the ' Master Suspense ' , but so far have n't see movie that would be able stand test time . my opinion Hitchcock have become household name which be too easily use promote ( cheap ) thriller , but other hand must admit be intrigue be European movie . normally be big Hollywood studio who like abuse Hitchcock 's name that can raise their income . but movie be make one most chauvinistic European country ever and be sure most French would rather drop dead admit their movie have be inspire Englishman . be why decide give movie try and must say be glad did."Sur mes lvres " or " read my lip " be call English , tell story young secretary name Carla . be hardwork and loyal employee , but have never be very appreciate her colleague . have much do fact suffer hearing deficiency , which have deny climb up hierarchical ladder company . but when be allow hire trainee that can work , all be about change . Paul Angeli be 25 year old and completely unskilled ex-convict . man be thief , but Carla give chance and cover when need . hope teach what regular life should look , but same time drag his old life ... still believe name Hitchcock be use too often describe very good thriller - which movie definitely be - will notmake comparison Hitchcock and Jacques Audiard 's directing . fact be man have do really good job movie . have n't hear , but be true know how build up suspense and how keep interested beginning end . that also have lot do very fine and original story course . doubt there be someone Hollywood who have ever come up idea use handicapped woman powerful role , instead make helpless subject abusive husband ( know , typical TV-movie story).Also worth notice be acting movie . Vincent Cassel be quite famous , but Emmanuelle Devos be complete mystery . there be absolutely nothing glamorous their role , but both do excellent job their character , make feel very believable and realistic . Paul could have be average tough guy right out jail and Carla typically helpless woman , but thanks their performance , really believe be two strong people who both have have bad luck life but who will make good out together.All all be powerful movie very fine script and excellent acting . fact have my doubt , have soon become one its great admirer . give movie positive . do n't hesitate give try .
death George Nader , 4 February 2002 , think most interesting program , which even have only short run , be tremendous idea good story line . generally unseen 40+ year would be worth viewing again . opening credit show many differ image , one which be snippit Colonel John Paul Stapp , ride his famed rocket sled , point where be often refer as " Fastest Man Alive " .

other reviewer have summarize film noir well . just want add " Whew ! " comment one reviewer make regard Elisha Cook 's obviously coke-fuelled drum episode . WAS doozy , must say . Cook deserve acclaim his frenzied performance.A bit trivia be surmise about : Cook appear waiter 1941 Barbara Stanwyck film , " Ball Fire . " be waiter nightclub where Barbara be sing and legendary drummer Gene Krupa be drum , most energetically . be too much suggest Cook 's spazzy drum late film , " Phantom Lady , " be very much inspire Krupa 's work , as witness Cook 3 year earlier ? watch Krupa " Ball Fire , " think will note clearly similar body movement . hope , course , that HE be notinfluence drug time !
" Home Room " " Zero Day " and " Elephant " , be inspire recent wave school shooting . but other two film , " Home Room " focus two survivor ( notshooter or kill ) aftermath shooting . make less exploitive and more useful little effort be waste ask question which there be answers.Do n't give up little film first 20 minute , be suppose set up real story but play reject " Hill Street Blues " episode . be lame but bear , least pad run length enough get film classify feature . recommend skip entirely and just jump ahead hospital scenes-there be nothing here ca n't pick up remainder film.Like lot good little film this be creatively one-man show Paul F. Ryan be both writer and director . arrangement do notguarantee good film , be usually good sign will mean certain unity construction and execution that be often lack big budget dramatic feature . script " Home Room " be its real strength be fortunate writer also execute production and insure his vision make screen.Ryan take huge chance ending which test limit average viewer 's sentimentality tolerance . run right up edge but logic leave cry instead cringe . why end work be combination audience need reward end kind journey , song ( Sarah McLaughlin 's " Sweet Surrender " ) go out , and amazing edit final minute.The other strength film be casting Busy Phillips ( Alicia ) and Erika Christensen ( Deanna ) main protagonist . Phillips play her standard alienate surly teen and Christensen her intelligent daughter good family , both bring more intensity their role ever before . family life girl be more satisfactory and little interest Ryan . what be happen here be all two lame side story police detective wonder town try tie Alicia lone shooter . ever re-cut and trim film side story should be condensed.A story two extremely disparate girl bond and help other be hardly novel idea and Ryan could have easily steer film clich and predictability . but instead his script have engage fascinating and convincing spar match , slowly chip away other and share moment vulnerability , only retreat back . Deanna 's " be die " line just tear apart-I ca n't think moment other film feel as intensely one . desperately need connection Alicia just as desperately resist . Deanna only make progress when retreat . viewer keep expect group hug that never seem happen.Ultimately notonly generate lot suspense but leave admire character and two actress who bring life.Then again , what do know ? be only child .
i actually think be comedy and sit watch expect laugh my ass off . pretty soon become clear be comedy , or least not' Jim Carrey type ' one . what keep watch be character - movie start pretty grim , troubled people , gather together try and fight their basic fear - fear water , fear swimming . start get bit bit their life , witness their trouble , guess their thoughts.actually i make look much dark actually be , and chain event soon bring light and hope their lives.i probably would n't have watch movie have i know its notcomedy but rather drama , but i have good time , enjoy story and do n't mind i spend about 90 minute it.many film treat alienation people western world , movie show how people can get together and help other"and light die day meet , do n't let pass and leave , do n't loose , be your gift sun ...

be undeniably scary game have ever play . be notaverage shoot-everything-that-moves kind fps ( which usually do n't care much ) , but acceptable gfx , interesting weapon and magic , great surround soundeffects ( " Scryeeee , scryeeee. .

show have few clichs and few top , Dawson 's Creek-like moment ( 16-year-old talking way back when life make sense ? ) , but overall seem decent show . most character seem very real , and story seem move along well pilot - end good lesson end . just hope episode do n't turn out be life-altering first , that would just be too much drama vehicle . Jeremy Sumpter do excellent job teenager passion baseball , believe lot could relate his awe and sometimes tunnel vision team always want part .

film do notfail engage and move , even 2008 audience only familiar modern over-produce sound and computer enhanced techniques.The experience movie goer 1922 who could only see cinema other their big screen must have be truly profound and thoroughly satisfying experience.One have ask could film maker today make two hour silent movie and make interesting and achieve same structure tempo and balance movie have . silent film making be pure art , have hold attention its structure , direction and act - there be no pad out more word or computer generate distraction . poorly make or uninteresting silent movie be unwatchable.This film need be put context who might be disconcert mention Christian theme . be not' Christiany ' film , be notsell anything . theme reference current moral standard often appear era - also church go Sundays be national past time , Christianity be give most household thus film be only depict normal life be then . theme would have ring true and deep time.It be most odd give strong support good Christian thinking particular movie ( and be notpreach religion anyone , only highlight difference hypocrite and honest)that 1922 Pastor open debate representative film industry large crowd denounce Pickford example immorality , along other individual name . NY Times 1922.Maybe should have watch movie that also come out 1922 and , learn lessons.The Pastor complain film industry have start church attendance have drop 500,000 . film representative debate however make follow observation ; saloon attendance have also drop , there be far more pastor prison actor ( fact ) and select few example many be notrepresentative whole.Thus there be ongoing battle church and film industry early day film.This be wonderful film be honest and true family friend and be willing make sacrifice . Mary Pickford , naive , honest , feisty , full happiness and joy , faithful , humorous and silently sacrifice - poor and uneducated represent perfect character . however be notthrust down our throat but reveal bit bit film.This be reminiscent modern Chinese film where character be slowly , languidly reveal course film and be tempo that create strong connection character.It have smooth even tempo first half that build all element last section . last 30 minute be great film make and have be appreciate be achieve benefit sound , run dialog - be achieve deft acting and great directing . be sometimes surprising realize end film have n't hear word speak , but feel have hear everything.The support cast put great performance especially Gloria Hope , Jean Hersholt and Lloyd Hughes.The final few minute be typical Pickford understate humor go outside pretext sweep snow , near perfect balance and end . be special type touching humor that should notbe underestimate . Chaplin use device often and copy some Pickford.Another special observation be make silent film and especially Pickford film be star often have hold camera much movie audience become jaded or bored , actor over-exposure . Pickford be usually thoroughly center attention most her movie but people still could n't get enough be testament her fine acting ability .
magical moment life , point beautiful innocence childhood , and confusing whirlwind that mark adulthood . . . be what movie be about.Danni ( wonderfully play Reese Witherspoon ) be right moment life when movie start . swoon Elvis , play his record and wishfully think love .

One look two and its all over . look pain and defeat Danni 's face be beautiful their trueness life and painful same time . rest movie will nottell but movie have more relationship boy and two sisters.The greatness movie be its depiction life moment both beautiful and painful and relationship two sister whose love be test both boy love , and pain must endure both together and individually . Danni eventually mark her entrance world when see world be unfair , painful , and maybe even little less hopeful when movie start . few movie can truly capture wonder childhood and pain adulthood so perfectly . movie have first time watch stick my mind . its my top 100 movie list and deservedly so . only wish more movie be make , so . . . my faith Hollywood would be lot well .
This be great movie . have captivating story , awesome main character , very good acting and killer action . take place mostly year 2036 but show scene that take place past year explain story.The story be very well do and there be hole .

" Le Locataire"("The Tenant")is doubt one most important horror movie ever made.Polanski star Trelkovsky,a timid file clerk living Paris,who answer advertisement apartment,only find previous tenant attempt suicide leap apartment window.Trelkovsky be compel visit hospital and there meet Stella(Isabelle Adjani).Trelkovsky immediately move when previous tenant die and,at first,is quite please have find such nice apartment.His happiness be soon replace wave paranoia become increasingly suspicious his neighbours,who seem be try provoke Trelkovsky repeat previous tenant 's suicide.This film be great.Polanski manage create surreal atmosphere dread and paranoia.Plenty brilliant moment such classic scene where Trelkovsky discover previous tenant 's tooth hole wall,or fever dream where wander building 's bathroom find wall cover hieroglyphics.The photography Sven Nykvist be truly beautiful."The Tenant " be neglected gem.It may be difficult track down,but be more worth effort .

 Undoubtedly one great John Ford 's masterpiece , Young Mr. Lincoln go practically unnoticed time its initial release , wonder year be 1939 when many great movie whole cinema history have be release , include most mythical Western history genre , John Ford 's milestone Stagecoach and many other , such Gone Wind , Wizard Oz , Mr. Smith go Washington which take Oscar only category Young Mr. Lincoln be nominate , which be original Screenplay.It continue be most underrate Ford 's film many year ahead destine gradually fade away shadow other John Ford 's masterpiece , but end 1950s American and European film critic and historian take hold note write legendary Russian director Sergei Eisenstein Young Mr. Lincoln where praise and acknowledge would only have have opportunity direct American film ever make then , would be definitely John Ford 's Young Mr. Lincoln . impress such undoubted preference Eisenstein , critic begin see film again but only bit different eye and film 's reputation have be increase ever since.It be far notfirst time life one most legendary American president be bring screen . right beginning 1930s Griffith do his Abraham Lincoln and same year Ford 's film , MGM release John Cromwell 's one call Abe Lincoln Illinois . curiously enough both be base very successful Broadway Stage Play release 1938 and write Robert Sherwood.As far John Ford 's film be concern , can easily find many reference life and deed and even death mythical Lincoln 's figure several director 's work , such 1924 Iron Horse or 1936 prisoner Shark Island , second one , just Young Mr. Lincoln , utilize main musical theme favourite Lincoln 's song - Dixie.The screenplay base previously mention Stage Play and Lincoln 's biography be write Lamar Trotti collaboration John Ford , which be quite rare thing Ford do but final result be simply superb - script combine element play several historical fact as well myth and legend beginning Abraham Lincoln 's life and law practice culminate hilarious but mostly heartbreaking trial scene , which be film 's high point and main laugh and tear generator , where Lincoln defend two young brother accuse murder and have devise manner help their mother too when be bring court witness and where prosecute attorney ( play Donald Meek ) demand indicate which one her son actually commit murder obviously oblige making impossible choice condemn death one and let live other.Overall be very touching , heart-warming and even funny film simply magnificent performance Henry Fonda his supreme characterization Abraham Lincoln and overwhelming richness other character matter how little or how big be incarnate wonderful and intelligent screenplay and conduct ability John Ford 's genius one its good delivery ever . definite must see everyone . positive
be quite far remove my expectation , be thoroughly impress Dog Bite Dog . rent notknow much , but essentially expect be martial arts/action film standard Hong Kong action tradition , which be devoted fan . end up get something entirely different , which be notall bad thing . film could be classify such , and there be definitely good action and hand hand combat scene film , be definitely notprimary focus . its character be infinitely more important film its fight , rather uncommon thing many Hong Kong action movies.I be really quite surprise intricacy character and character relationship film . lead character , play Edison Chen ( who be really very good ) , become infinitely more complex end film ever think would be watch first thirty minute . police character also defy my expectation thoroughly . fact , stark and honest portrayal seldom see dark side police force be quite possible my favorite aspect film . do n't know would say Dog Bite Dog entirely subvert typical notion bad criminal , good cop , but certainly distort way notoften see film ( unfortunately ) . many film , especially Hong Kong action film find , portray police what be frankly VERY ignorantly idealize light . be one my least favorite thing genre . be pleasantly surprise see Dog Bite Dog actually have very unique , and really quite courageous , idea present police force . there be negotiation scene film have never see like before , and doubt will ever see again , and be sure will remember quite while . also , criminal character be show interesting perspective well , there be documentary footage film Cambodian boy no old ten be make fight other death their bare hand , which think be one film 's most powerful and move moment . say lot reason guy be way be , rather simply condemn . also , relationship Chen 's character and girl meet junk yard reveal lot his character . be n't element enter film really start see film emotional experience rather only visceral one . there be something most screen relationship that do n't quite get , but reason one really do . actress do incredible job role which imagine be noteasy play.Dog bite Dog also feature really breathtaking cinematography , all be unfortunately rather uneven . there be moment find really striking , particularly last segment film , but there be also good deal camera work that be just OK . slight problem have be pace , which also feel be uneven . find lot " look boat " scene be little alienating , all quickly pick up . action scene be short and nottoo plentiful , but be truly powerful and effect , particularly end . fight choreography be honestly notall impressive most part , all its credit be solid and fairly realistic , but true strength be emotional content fight . final scene , notmarvel martial artistry or fight choreography , be one most powerful final fight have ever see , and have see quite few martial art films.I suppose big determine factor or notwill get much out Dog Bite Dog be or notcan connect character . be certainly more flawed character be likely see film kind , but there be something very human could n't help but be draw and really feel , particularly Chen 's girlfriend . should say doubt most people will like film as much do simply imagine most people will notlike or care character same way , but still recommend highly all same . be truly deeply move and effect film give chance .
This be great movie good story . my child ( 10 , 7 , 5 , and 4 ) love movie , include . music be also fantastic . no , horse do nottalk , but instead , story be tell Spirit . and hear story tell horse 's point view be fun.I think title say , " spirit " . movie really give sense family and home and friend . would have say my 4 year old boy and 5 year old girl be really touch movie , and even get so , laugh so hard , and cheer spirit end.Enjoy " spirit " your family and have your spirit lift heartwarming story . your kid will love . think will too .

Naziism have be stop , and anything that help do be good . give his child line be bad , and should notbe bad , but say earlier when converse adult , would do sort thing again hesitation . Lukas do give excellent portrayal man catch situation , and make clear what do be very hard thing do.Some people think his victim be Nazi , but do n't think so - think be only money . his Nazi associate know and be why do nothave much use him.One interesting point film , and presumably also play , be fact Muller ( Lucas ) be German . anti German hysteria WWI be notrepeat WWII , there be considerable anti-German sentiment and Germans be inter similar what happen California people Japanese ancestry . be something act bravery Hellman write play good Germans time ( maybe think be one who sign Nazi-Soviet pact ! ) . , US and British air force be bomb German city and have qualm kill innocent civilian . think , however , Dresden bombing and firestorm happen later , " Watch Rhine " be released.The title be something play word , " watch " be look west , Germany . fact , Watch be Rhein be German army march song - use WWII , but Nazis have their own march song that be use as well . but Muller be German and be engage his own " Wach be Rhein".All other actor do excellent job here ; Bodo be too much there be child . be surprised do notgive his father 's secret away . real life , may very well have do so .

first glance , would seem natural compare where Sidewalk Ends Laura . have noirish quality , both be direct Otto Preminger , and star Dana Andrew and Gene Tierney . but be where most comparison end . Laura deal posh , sophisticated people mean who just happen find mixed-up murder . where Sidewalk Ends be set completely different stratum . be people barely two nickel rub together who be more accustom see underbelly society go fancy dress party . where Sidewalk end be gritty film fill desperate people who solve their problem their fist or other weapon . small-time hood be dime-a-dozen and cop routinely beat confession out crook . get caught-up murder investigation seem as natural breathing.While have n't see his entire body work , base what have see , Dana Andrew give one his good performance beat-down cop , Det . Sgt. Mark Dixon . be kind cop who be use rough up local hood get information or confession . One night , go too far and accidentally kill man . do his good cover up . but thing get complicate when fall dead man 's wife , Morgan Taylor ( Tierney ) , whose father become suspect number one murder case . Morgan 's father mean world , Dixon be get do what can clear old man implicate himself.Technically , where Sidewalk Ends be outstanding . terrific performance Andrew , movie feature always delightful Tierney . have quality that can make even bleak moment seem bright . rest cast be just as solid Tom Tully wrongly accuse father be real standout . acting , direction , set , lighting , and cinematography be all top-notch . overall , be amazingly well make film.If have one complaint ( and admittedly be very , very minor quibble ) be Tierney be almost too perfect role and her surroundings . be little difficult believe woman that could find mixed-up unsavory character . be notreally her fault , be just way Tierney come across . seem little too beautiful , polished , and delicate part . but , her gentle , kind , trust nature add sense need realism her portrayal .

I be glad be available DVD now . film be excellent example triumph content & style empty-headed flash light & constant loud noises.Essentially , have short attention span or lack wit & imagination engage literary narrative wo n't like film . reason be quite simple , but unfortunately rarely achieve : Matthew Jacobs have do fantastic job transpose story Catherine Storr 's novel ' Marianne Dreams ' successfully screenplay . unenviable task anyone who have see film book will undoubtedly know.The casting be excellent , allow director Bernard Rose use actor way that be rarely see now ; indulge craft act ! know , know , actor do their job & act instead resort mug inanely camera lens whist kaleidoscope car chase , explosion & fire fight break out be genuinely rare treat , but do actually happen film.This bring final reason be film imaginative thinker & notspoon-feed tabloid reader - apart solid script , direction & act , rely atmosphere , suspense & implied horror . be be categorize horror then presentation ' Paper House ' be more vein Sophocles Tobe Hooper.In conclusion then , like lot loud noise , explosion , constant cut , & bright flash colour will be good off watch ' Transformers ' , but like suspenseful story which unfold skillful & evocative use narrative insult your intelligence force feed cacophonous nonsense then might just be your thing .

Fox ( my all-time favorite actor ) , Chance be basically all will expect dog , lovable , playful , energetic and goofy , and time crack up when watch movie , be Chance ; be comedy never end ! movie be also very sad time . sometimes remind people time have be alone or when lose their pets.One scene that always put suspense be scene where trio be try escape pound ; especially feel shock part where Chance get his collar catch fence and almost do n't make . movie have other suspenseful moment , but none seem more suspenseful one.Overall , be wonderful family movie . enjoy movie , will probably enjoy sequel too . give movie solid 9 10 !

Ms. Minton 's novel operate level personal and intimate her central character , so internally , seem impossible place physical realm . even lot book be memory real event , be memory , and so fragmented and ethereal as be , feel , notfilmable . think Ms. Minton 's work be real work literature , but can make transition film , which way detract its value.I can yet report Evening , film , do notrepresent Evening , novel , more most superficial way , be only halfway , but original would have make tremendous leap resemble film that follow point . guess be write feel be go adapt novel , adapt , but do n't make something else be not. be notsure Michael Cunningham have do anything wholly original , but what can see so far thing have do be all base someone else 's work . would nothave hour Virginia Woolf have notwrite Mrs. Dalloway , and would nothave Evening , its distressed form , Susan Minton have nothave so much trouble do what probably should nothave be attempt first place . but be too much say would be good Ms. Minton have leave well enough alone , Evening , film , be satisfactory and beautiful work its own.Thus my confusion , mixed feeling , sense disloyalty , and ultimate conclusion , case , novel can be film and vice versa , and my eventual gratitude writer do what do , that have work be .
have never be huge Imax film . be cool , but once get initial rush " Whoa , feel fly ! " movie be usually pretty corny and ordinary.The exception have be powerful " Everest " , exhilarate " Wild California " and now BBC 's " Human Body " , super-sized look inside our bodies.Our body be machine complexity that be simply inconceivable . 50 minute film could be 10 hour long , and still would n't get system work tandem just type review and listen my radio , and most take all granted.Here can see inside pump heart ( look alien spaceship ) , inside your lung , tiny hair your eardrum process sound , development baby mother 's womb , and surprisingly , few ... um , less attractive function think would shy away ( pimple , churning acid stomach ... )This film also have rather funky style , which set apart other Imax documentary . instance , have all see sperm find its way egg , but have ever see set tune Marvin Gaye 's " let be get " ? be creative moment that make " Human Body " notjust health lesson , but fun well .
have decide notbelieve what famous movie critic say . even movie do notget good comment , movie make my day . get think . what false world is.What do do when your most love one deceive . be say matter how often feed milk snake , can never be loyal and will bite when give chance . same way people be such be never grateful . movie be about how selfish people can be and how everyone be ultimately just think and work oneself.A brother die inadvertently hand gangster . survive brother decide take revenge . process , learn futility world . nothing be real and no be loyal anyone.Amitabh give performance his life . new actor Aryan give good performance . actress who play wife Amitabh steal show . her role be small but portray her role so diligently be move her performance . Chawla have really great face expression but her role be very limit and be notgive chance fully express herself.A great movie Raj Kumar Santoshi . his movie always give message audience . his movie be novel Nanak Singh ( Punjabi novelist who have novel always have purpose and target social evil ) have real message audience . be entertain as well lesson-giving .
My friend and pick " Paperhouse " random pile movie our weekly excursion Horror section -- neither have hear , but blurb box be really promising . and movie do n't disappoint , still probably would n't call horror movie exclusively.11-year old Anna Madden draw house , and visit her dream . be definitely asleep when be see house , but be so real sense be almost completely separate reality . which , view late event , do n't seem far cry truth . anyhow , find can add house , its content and its surroundings simply add picture.While be go on , Anna be get increasingly more ill fever , and that be get totally obsessed house and her drawing . top , and her mother be also deal her absent father ; have job that take away long stretch , get impression there be actually more story that.OK , so drawing stuff sound nice enough -- but frankly there be something really menace . dreamworld be eerily surreal -- house , instance , be just grey block middle desolate field . folk who make movie do great job make very uncomfortable alternate world/ongoing dream ... One thing Anna add house be boy , Mark , who seem be same patient her doctor keep talk ( be notgive away , know moment appear be same kid ) . reality , Mark ca n't walk due illness ; Anna 's drawing-world , ca n't walk do n't draw leg . blame his real-life illness , and try rectify situation , but ... everything start get really weird . even bring her absent father drawing , disastrous result . bit father be really terrifying.I do n't want give anything away , so will stop there ... there seem be lot go film . be sure will have ball analyze thing do death your pal watch -- be simple story seem , or be there actually layer meaning ? do n't know , but way be quite fascinating . there be " Nightmare Elm Street"-ish quality , certain point reality and dream intersect . love thing that.My only complaint be feel COULD have end many time , but do n't . be satisfy end have ( sensitive type might want have Kleenex handy ! ) , really could have variety conclusion . anyway , do n't exactly feel draw out be actually over , but be watch and keep fade back , be little nerve wracking.Still , " Paperhouse " be really Good film . be well do , and act -- especially Charlotte Burke Anna -- be top notch . Burke , who have never before or since appear film , be real gem . do n't know why never go do anything else , but way be really convincing and enjoyable watch."Paperhouse " be n't exactly horror movie , be sort fantasy/suspense/something else type movie , definite horroresque moment -- but can still watch your family and notbe worry your little brother or grandmother will get gross out blood splash or something.Give chance , wo n't regret ! and maybe should read book , too ...

@card@ might seem unusually high score such slight film , however , compare hundred and hundred series detective film 1930s and 40s , be very good and also compare very favorably Powell 's later " thin man " film . now do notmean film be similar thin man movie , Kennel MURDER Case be notcomedy but more traditional mystery-detective film . now will think nothave Nora Charles or Asta or traditional comic sidekick ( something find practically series detective film ) fun would be detriment , but do n't miss be such exceptionally well-write film--having genuinely interesting case well as uniformly excellent performance all.The film begin dog show and be call Kennel Murder Case , Philo Vance film actually spend little time dog show and dog be notsuper-important part film . instead , thoroughly hate man be kill and leave completely seal room--an idea repeat quite few other detective film ( such Crime Doctor 's STRANGEST Case ) . however , how all be explain seem pretty credible and fit together very well--keeping my interest . sure wish other detective film day have as intelligently write plot and exceptional act one . one be definitely keeper .

Nekromantik movie be Ok , even kind interesting and unique their approach subject Necrophilia ( even obviously be horror-opera entry rather intend invoke fear viewer mind , be actually quite funny.)TODESKING , other hand be , my opinion , one good film ever make . consist series scene depict many facet death . death enemy ; death reliever , death very fysical decomposition body . film be metaphor life . show how fragile life be and how short our life be . reduce its viewer childs ( ) actually be . fact can really understand nature death , and hence neither process die , be core message film . be most realistic film . never do Buttgereit try hide death white rose or whatever . matter what moral standard set up , death be unevitable , and will sooner or later be notfiction but YOUR reality . apply , Dear Reader , apply viewer film . juvenile reviewer seem notgrasp , which be fully excuse , course will live forever ... be exploitation movie . why ? death do notexploit human . harvest . grow seven day , then be bring back Schopenhauerian state pre-birth , that be death .

This be very strange film director/animator Richard Williams . who know William 's work know be bit off-kilter ( notingenious ) but one take cake.It feature two hapless ragdolls who have save their owner 's new French doll lustful pirate toy and find mercy several bizarre character way . strength movie lie primarily its aesthetic quality ; its strange character design , its powerful animation , and its stark contrast sweet and scary . Williams ' brilliant animation portray Raggedy Ann and Andy real rag doll , floppy and darned , rather simple cartoon version doll , which make more believable ( least visual sense ) . animation shine bring Camel-with-the-Wrinkled-Knees , whose body walk two different personality control end , silent-movie chase Sir Leonard Looney and , course , Greedy.The Greedy animation , its own , be possibly most exquisite psychedelic animation have ever see . there be something animation that just make your jaw drop--and second be something new . live what be deem " Taffy Pit , " Greedy be massive blob man that live and mercilessly eat sweet . sing song ca n't help but feel hold sexual undertone , then try kill Raggedy Ann her candy heart.The only complaint have about film be there be too many song . continuously bogs down movie 's pace there be SIXTEEN . there be about six good song ( which should have be only one ) include " look , and what do see ? " , " Girl 's Toy " , " Blue " ( do n't need make sing twice ) , " never get Enough " , " love " and maybe " be Home . " other just seem unnecessary and frankly be n't too amazing listen to.This be weird film strange undertone , but be what be look , wo n't find well .
will marvel incredibly sophisticated computer animation , and novelty probably wo n't wear off first , second or third viewing , but ? ll be draw character which be so simple yet intriguing , may find actually caring unexpected way , which may or may notmake feel little childish due medium.Disney continue firmly hold title " Greatest Animation World " , " Bug ? s life " standing one their great achievement . One innovative attachment be delightful " out-takes " add end film . DVD have two set out-takes where ? m tell VBS cassette have one alternate version tape . DVD also feature " Gerry ? s game " which be delightful little Pixar short that be also show prior film theaters.This be far superior insect-film comparison Dreamworks ? " Antz " , which fairness be pretty good , but lack something animation and story development and character . look star voice film , " Antz " be largely cast big name " movie " star few familiar " TV " star voice , where " Bug ? s life " be just opposite , load " TV " star Kevin spacey only stand exception . but difference quality be distinct and obvious.Dreamworks can ? t be blame or surprise though , when go head head Disney , have your work cut out . be kind film that almost make wish have child share . Don ? t think second be just movie kid , though .

Kelly Ripa do great job one other suspect . when come villain , be glad Penguin be one , but do notfact replace Paul Williams David Ogden Stiers .

what can be say compelling performance Tara Fitzgerald ? be utterly believable injured Mrs Graham , harden experience , sharp and strong-willed , yet notimmune passionate attention Mr Markham . mischievous glance and flare temper , flicker discernment his eye and tell facial expression , Toby Stephens be master his character . be force passion and hope that will restore Helen 's injured spirit . Graves ' Huntingdon be perfect performance unreformable rogue . yet have do , there be undeniable human dignity his refusal play hypocrite end ; be least aware his own failing and how have bring his ruin . Helen 's attempt save his soul -- leave and take their child time when be unheard of--is triumph hope , hope and faith worth human life and soul , however misguide , however sinful person may be . Markham 's constancy may then be see her reward her faith and unyielding moral character . opinionated idea morality so strongly present Tenant seem outdated today 's standard , story be imbue integrity , passion , and conviction which still make impact . tenant be far more believable Wuthering Heights or even Jane Eyre ; here be adaptation that do novel justice . highly recommend view !
other comment list here , be probably good Dirty Harry movie make ; film that reflect -- good or bad -- country 's socio-political feeling Reagan glory year early ' 80 's . be also kickass action movie.Opening liberal , female judge overturn murder case due lack tangible evidence and then go straight coffee shop encounter several unfortunate hoodlum ( scene which prompt famous , " Go ahead , make my day " line ) , " Sudden Impact " be one non-stop roller coaster action film . first time get catch your breath be when troublesome Inspector Callahan be send away nearby city investigate background murder hood . get only good there over-the-top group grotesque thug Callahan deal along sherriff mysterious past . superb direction and photography and at-times hilarious script help make film one good ' 80 's .
 Honestly , find film almost too depressing my own good . be VERY depress pretty much very end . there be way can justify pass judgement character who do thing do n't like ( well , disgusting character play Fredrick Forrest ) . but be still so frustrating see people behave way , put up wall when just word or so could break ice and promote healing.A horrible tragedy strike Montana family . believe have lose one son , but turn have lose 2 . key be , just communicate and face their grief together , wo n't end up lose their second son permanently.But just ca n't . something be block family share their sorrow . family retreat silence and resentment certain other point finger blame ( and then go ahead and cheat their poor pregnant wife seduce pretty girlfriend deceased ... Andy character truly be snake ! ) only member family that be n't threaten Arnold way be his Grandpa ( Wilford Brimley ) . grandpa seem be able speak boy judgement or even kid glove . seem know what child be think about even Arnold be n't say much day . be truly blessing poor kid have one someone can turn . one else seem grasp fact Arnold might be shock , denial , or his way grieve may notbe same style , or same speed , would expect . be so easy judge and be angry and feel someone be " make stone " just do n't grieve way believe ought.The story be very quiet and naturalistic . be notgo get spoon-feed narration or Hollywood feel-good resolution . be very concern fact child be so burden guilt feel necessary hitchhike several hundred mile apologize piggy Andy 's wife , something should notblame . Arnold may have accidentally kill his brother , but nobody be responsible end marriage , which apparently be lousy one anyway , two people marriage . be only dumb luck Arnold do n't get car pedophile or murderer.Robert Duvall and Glenn Close be frustratingly effective parent who somehow can find communicate their son , find out what Arnold be go through . Jason Presson , whom have notsee anywhere else childhood favorite call explorer and creepy ghost story call Lady White , do incredible job Arnold , great performance child actor.Aside be somewhat slow time , Stone Boy be excellent , and very depressing movie .
should nottake what be about say lightly . have see many , many film and have review great deal , print . so when tell film have single funny scene have ever see movie , might want listen . there be lot diversity opinion what make INCREDIBLY stupid movie funny be . and who just do n't get , well , ca n't blame , too much . scene speak , come 30 minute mark and involve dead convict shackle John Candy . up point , have find film dumb , confusing and be begin lose . when scene come up , laugh so hard , pee my pant . movie have ever do . when project begin , " Going Berserk " be suppose be SCTV movie . remember be announce . time go , cast be whittle down John Candy , Joe Flaherty & Eugene Levy . there also must have be regime change Universal , be be shoot , because be release , be show nearly Zero theater . when watch second time , listen theme song ( which actually flaunt how incomprehensible plot be , lyric ) , relax my logic nerve and figure out what be go . aside aforementioned routine , " Going Berserk " have many other hilarious scene recommend . be almost 3 Stooges flick , be much funny . Director David Steinberg have razor sharp timing , and must have be laugh . as Candy , who be basically charge here , have NEVER be funny . all plot device and explanatory scene throw window , absolutely run wild . Flaherty and Levy follow effortlessly . there be plot , but be plot " Animal House " have plot , and yeah , script be uneven , and little slow start . once know , however , can well appreciate full SCTV style craziness that transpire . be stupid , but be stupid purpose , and need remember when see . do see , and discover , have funny scene time .
mere fact still think movie decade later be what really speak volume film . substantiate Grand Canyon film that will touch one way or . truly believe movie crash there be Grand Canyon . major difference two film my opinion be timing their release . be notgo argue which be good , but will contend idea share same message . will love hear that have opinion subject . will start commentary which can find http://www.myspace.com/62229249 . may also find there post other topic movie may share , i have true love film .
have n't see film year my knowledge be little rusty . do remember think film be twice film Braveheart . be simply more realistic and have more believable character . Ridb Roy look would imagine Rob Roy look like , messy hair and beard simple clothing . also Liam Nesson have Celtic look , look Scot and more importantly look Rob Roy . be comparison which anger people but compare Mel Gibson William Wallace . Gibson be supposedly play man who be legend have cause be describe 6 foot 7 giant Gibson be almost foot short . story contain little romance , conspiracy and underdog story . sound anything Braveheart ? but instead film that cry " freedom " , liberty and nationalism get film which say honour , love and justice . make more interesting film . much Gladiator . cast be fantastic and Liam Nesson be very strong leader endeavour . story be great how deal heroism and humanity . scene where Mary be rape and walk out burning house look true Scottish strength be follow her wash semen her crotch extreme panic . be something heroine Braveheart would never do . overall be stunning and almost flawless watch . go and see !
My school 's drama club will be put show spring 2002 , and can only hope be as good ! watch film recently sort " research " my role ( Rosie Alvarez ) , and will just like say , Vanessa Williams be cool ! wow ! casting movie be right-on ( one exception ) .

Vanessa Williams , say before , be cool . be beautiful Rosie , and her transition secretary seductress be totally believable . Tyne Daly be hilarious Albert 's obnoxious mother and George Wendt be superb annoyed Mr. McAfee ( however I LOVED Paul Lynde 's performance 1963 version ! ) . Brigitta Dau crack up Ursula Merkle ; really ham up ! and Marc Kudisch be awesome Conrad Birdie ... " Suffer ! " there be only one casting do n't understand , and , will see previous comment , many other people do n't understand . Chynna Phillips Kim McAfee - what be ? mean be really pretty and very talented , but ... look bit too old role . Eh , maybe be delusional.Okay well anyways , highly recommend movie . will leave smile !
fantastic film country , where due decade oppression fundamentalist regime , have problem create passionate subject matter . Panahi take different approach time around blend ironic comedy and endear , non-professional cast . still get his message what see be inherently wrong his country , do so need heavy storyline . be positive take country , particular its people , Iranian population desperately need . great pity be wo n't be release domestically . insular , paranoid Iranian government assert fine film maker be only successful overseas be part global conspiracy embarrass . grow up revolution and watch academic , artist and educate ' disappear ' last 25 year show great bravery continue put his work out there . realism achieve shoot actual world cup qualifier really transport event . fact shoot 35mm be amazing most would only attempt project use digital format . look fantastic . his insistence only use non-professional actor also really work film . fine performance round . watch many film show problem Iran have and also news medium report fact can tend demonise people as well government . film do opposite . show still love same thing and laugh and absurd rule sharia law maybe change better be n't too far away . call Panahi feminist film maker but think just fight most oppress demographic Iran . young , independent woman .
i choose see film day open nationally france , personal way reflect what have happen year previous ; collection work as intend : provoke whirlwind thought and emotion , work intellectual hommage , never stoop cheap sentimentality nor knee-jerk reactionism.there have be many allegation make film be anti-american : i can speak everyone regard , i be one American who find such statement be completely untrue . people make much noise Egyptian segment , Chahine , voice perspective Palestinian suicide bomber assert civilian democracy be " fair target " elect government bomber be seek attack , but ignore much else piece : several perspective be discuss , no one be hold up truth , and critics--if even see piece--seem forget fondness and warm dialogue that take place director and ghost American dialogue , and director 's intense sadness hearing tragedy.pretty much all film be beautiful , thoughtful & inspiring , particular brilliant work Mahkmalbaf , Tanovic , Loach & Inarritu . Nair , good usual , effectively tell true story injustice commit Muslim family wake anti-islam hysteria swept--and still sweeps--the state . i do find Gitai 's piece bit vulgarly loud and simple be critic medium hysteria face terrorism , and Penn 's piece be too impressionistic and elliptical my taste , i have expect like . Borgnine be very good and brave . spoiler Warning : one reviewer incorrectly read fall tower be happy moment character ; my read be rather fall tower be what , light flood his room , key loss his life refuse recognize . again be sort impressionistic piece , know tower be really block light man 's flat , then there would have be nothing but smoke and ash , notlight , flood his window .
movie be visually stunning . who care can act or not. scene be work art compose and capture John Derek . location , set design , and costume function perfectly convey what be find love story comprise beauty , youth and wealth . way would like see movie tribute John and Bo Derek 's story . and ... commentary would notbe complete mention Anthony Quinn 's role father , mentor , lover , and his portrayal man , man , lose bygone era when man be man . there be who find value strength and direction wrap confidence that contribute sense confidence , containment , and security . yes , do notmake man anymore ! but , then how often do find woman who be make Bo Derek .
only wish return Jedi , have be direct somebody else , mean , there be far too much ewoks scene , completely unnecessary . time our hero look different people : Princess Leia long fight Solo , Luke look boring , Darth Vader be notas evil before , and Yoda just dies.But there be many extraordinary thing go episode i just ca n't hate it.SOME SPOILERS 1- Jabba hut 2- Sail Barge attack sequence . 3-The emperor ( now be evil ) 4- Speeders chase endor forest . 5-The last battle . 6-The dark side seduction scene . 7-The return Anakin good side force . 8- and last celebration.Some be so good can bring tear your eye . scene would have be cut , and director be hire , would have be as perfect episode 4 and 5 , but still be extraordinary . 9 out 10 .

where be film when be kid ? his parent split up Tadashi move his mom live his his grandfather . Tadashi 's sister stay their dad and talk frequently phone . grandfather be only " here " third day . mom never really home . kid always be pick poor kid . village festival Tadashi be choose " kirin rider " or spiritual champion peace and justice . Little do suspect soon will have actually step role hero force darkness join up rage thing discard plot destroy mankind and spiritual world.Okay that be easy part . now come hard part , try explain film.This be great kid film . no be great film,flawed , ( very flaw ? ) but great film none less . unfold great book love kid and be just as dense time Tadashi struggle find strength become hero . watch feel be read great book , and think how huge would have be be book . love film do notfollow normal path . thing often happen out happenstance or miscommunication , one character get suck event simply his foot fall asleep . there be twist and turn and moment that seem non sequiters and be all more charming ( which be typical Miike ) certainly its Takashi Miike film . Japanese master film be clearly charge film often touching , scary and funny all same time . one Miike seem understand can have many emotion same time , or can suddenly have twist thing get dark one second and then funny next . admire fact Miike have make film that be bleak and hopeful , that do n't shy away be scary , mean really scary , especially kid . be same dark territory that should be Harry Potter movie but rarely be . dark Grimms tale humor . my first reaction see opening image be could n't believe anyone would begin kid film picture end world , then realize who be make movie . hat off Miike make movie that know kid can handle frightening images.Its also operate more one level . mechanical monster bad guy make be forge mankind 's discard junk . its rage be throw away fuel monsters.One Yokai ( spirit ) talk rage sneakers throw away be dirty or too small feel when be toss . also have one good guy refuse join bad guy that would be human thing do . its wild concept , but other thing float its what lift movie level . ( there be good many riff and reference other movies,TV show and novel that make wonder who film be kid may notunderstand , many parent will ) and course there be monster . run gamut cheesy spectacular stop everywhere . frankly have forgive unevenness their creation simply be have be hundred notthousand monster screen . its way cool and work . One main character be Yokai which think be well describe hamster tunic and be often play stuffed animal , look dumb and yet will be cheer little bugger and love moment ride Tadashi 's head . ( Acceptance be also easy have ever see old woodcut weird Japanese monster ) mention flaw , and there be few . effect be uneven , sudden turn be bit odd ( even understandable ) and few other minor thing which be fade now two hour watch film. . none truly hurt film , however most kind keep be completely happy movie.I really love movie . be pretty sure see kid would have be my favorite film time . ( where be English dub ? ).See movie . its great trip . ( its good introduction film Miike minus blood and graphic sex )

be n't sure what expect movie consider its amazing collection star and director but end do n't disappoint.For one highlight be final episode American tourist speak dreadful French accent ( which make feel good mine ) which be actually quite touching and great way wrap up movie.The story paramedic and stab victim be also very move and pure comedy Coen Brothers and Steve Buscemi take award . Tom Tykwer clip be also impressive rather ambitious its scope.However , Bob Hoskins segment be totally cringeworthy and vampire story be completely farcical . dialogue Wes Craven 's section also feel very force and Chinatown story be completely incomprehensible.On whole film be worth watch good bit and have strong finish . be nottoo painful sit bad section - only last 5 minute anyway.Ca vaut la peine ! ! !

consider bit connoisseur box movie and such there be only one thing that prevent call " Gentleman Jim " good boxing movie ever make . be Robert Wise/Paul Newman flick " Somebody there Likes Me . " movie might be number 1 , but " Gentleman Jim " be close number 2.The movie do n't just chronicle rise James J. Corbett , also show sport box crucial time transition . late 1800s boxing be move away brutal day bare-knuckle rule more " gentlemanly " day glove , Marquis Queensbury rule . and sport be move away day when be illegal spectacle and time acceptance and respectability."Gentleman Jim " be notrealistic look day . be romanticize and , yes , even bit hokey time . but always delightfully so . Errol Flynn be perfect " Gentleman " Jim who really be n't " gentleman " all but merely fast talker work class family . Alexis Smith be quite ravish upper class woman whom have love/hate relationship ( and all know be , course , love that will win match end).At end " Gentleman Jim " great John L Sullivan ( whose famous line be not" can lick man world " course ... romanticism again ) hand his belt Corbett . be truly one good scene sport move ever make . realistic ? No. but wonderful . hey , want realism watch " Raging Bull " instead . be much more realistic boxing movie . but " Gentleman Jim " be lot more fun .

absolute classic ! ! direction be flawless , acting be just superb . word fall short great work . most definitive movie Mumbai Police . movie have stand test times.Om Puri give stellar performance , Smita Patil no less . all actor have do their good and movie race thrill moment . movie shake your whole being badly and force rethink many issue that confront our society.This be story cop ( Om Puri ) who start out his career honest man but ultimately degenerate killer . first attempt Bollywood get scene and expose depressing truth Mumbai cop . kudos Nihalani ! !After movie slew Bollywood movie get release expose criminal-politician-police nexus . thus movie be truly trend setter . trend dominate Hindi movie scene more decade.This movie be moderate box office hit.A must-see discerning movie fan .
1st season be amazing , whole idea adjust island , mystery be be explore ( and see ) be just phenomenal ; fill suspense , ton cliffhanger , and amazing plot . mean , love whole idea just see get use island . and then first see smoke monster first episode really catch my attention . then on , be hook second season be right par 1st season , only little good . absolutely love idea hatch and DHARMA Initiative . whole plot and sequence season 2 be mysterious , creepy , and exciting . love all suspense surround other island , but DHARMA story really make season 2 amazing.Season 3 be n't quite as good 1 and 2 ... but nonetheless , great . love see back-stories other , see their camp , and see mystery further explore . ( " Tricia Tanak I Dead " be one my favorite episode ) . season , notas good , be still breathtaking and fun , but most exciting ! now , 4th season . have hope season , and 1st couple episode be good , but then really start get boring and monotonous . mean , really despise new " rescuer " such Miles and Daniel . plot get old first couple episode ... and MOST ALL ... . season 4 be strip away something which make LOST perfect series : mystery , suspense , comedy mix ( Charlie go ) and overall excitement . also , my favorite character have leave .
Eddie Murphy DELIRIOUS be easily funny stand-up concert film have ever see . most stand-up act usually have lull point , but notone folk . 90 min there be notone moment that be notside-splittingly funny . moment Eddie do hilariously dead-on impression Mr.T , laugh be non-stop.Sadly , be do 1983 , and Eddie have n't do anything nearly as funny . be unbelievable man who write phenomenally brilliant show , write movie call Harlem NIGHTS which be notvery funny all.Eddie , be out there , please go back and do concert film vein DELIRIOUS . believe your fan will love . and think know that .
be lucky enough catch movie volunteer Maryland Film Festival . have always be fan classic horror film and especially gimmick William Castle , so be definitely must-see me.This be about life and work William Castle , who my opinion be underrate director . true , make cheap budget schlocky horror film , but add something film : real live theater gimmick that do n't see anymore . example , have nurse case someone have heart attack his movie and put vibrator bottom chair TINGLER.This be truly well-made documentary and bring rather shadow director light , and celebrate his contribution horror cinema . also paint Castle large life character , who be very well-like and have smile his face.Unlike most film documentary that mostly show testament film historian , Spine Tingler ! show interview mostly his family member and director who be influence his work , such John Waters , John Landis , and Joe Dante . must see classic horror and sci-fi fan .
there be movie , and there be film . movie be more often notmerely cinematic " candy , " film be true work art . fraulein Doktor be certainly well-place latter . most viewer , be highly impress battle scene , but poignancy portrayal central character be what consider be most sterling quality film . have do everything possible serve her country true daughter Deutschland , all while throes morphine addiction , die fraulein be treat very shabbily German high command her effort . scene which Doktor be be convey rear seat Mercedes Benz command auto , alone , desolate , and sob be perhaps one sad yet true depiction " spy 's " lot life . only emotional pain present Richard Burton Spy who Came Cold come close . fraulein Doktor be far deep film one may realize singular viewing . only wish its producer would see fit release DVD so who have never experience can , and who have see can again ( perhaps again and again)enjoy exceptional motion picture .
can stop say how much love movie . movie be one least know and one funny movie have ever see . movie follow exploit rap group , NWH ( Ni#$%rs Hats ) go beginning group end group , be tragic break up . follow group be documentary maker Nina Blackburn.The movie be shoestring budget , but do notseem matter , be very well make , well produce film and performance actor and actress be excellent . main strength movie be writing , there be so many brilliant line and takeoff rap movie , be unreal.SPOILERThere be takeoff actual rapper , MC Slammer , Vanilla Sherbert , Ice Cold , Tone Def , Tastey-Taste , and song ( Booty Juice , Grab your Dick , Etc. ) Rusty Condieff have make excellent film . movie play rapper Ice Cold . movie do notquit , be funny beginning end.The movie work so well become outlandish occasion , but strike line where be funny go too far out there . listen three lead try talk kind philosophy be one good part movie , Tone Def tell record producer , when take bus , get there ' , and producer respond , that be deep ! ' group portray N.W.H. have sort natural chemistry . work so well together , and manage pull movie where there be notweek moment film . what really make movie so good be how true rap group time movie be . many rap group have problem violence , censor , and NWA , group only become popular when establishment begin make big deal out controversial lyrics.I movie be offensive . there be something here offend everyone good natured way . movie have takeoff good number people too outside rap , funny be Spike Lee . where come up dialogue can imagine . movie have line line that will have rolling floor . say writing be just excellent.I be notsurprise movie meet such limited release . be intelligent , controversial , and even think provoking film . be too much mainstream , fact be hilarious , and nearly flawless 's production . there be major star , but lot familiar face , include Marc Lawrence , who play Tone Def . watch movie , very least will definitely have opinion .
think be utterly charming film . story seem be thinly veil autobiography John Waters : pecker 's great gift be his ability find beauty unexpected place . Edward Furlong do well lead , but good performance be his grandmother , Mink Stole ( hilarious cameo ) and , people , Patty Hearst . think reviewer be way base one . seem be take Pecker 's bad valuation his work gospel , when think film pretty clearly state be indeed promising artist .
Born To BOOGIE be real ' find'--though rock fan nearly thirty year , only first see film few day ago , and rank top rock film time ; music be terrific ( cream T. Rex ) and visual consistently exciting and unusual , leave viewer crave more past directorial effort Ringo Starr , who do fine job here . love music , will be T. Rextasy , Marc Bolan really be star piece , front and center . even fact song be repeat do n't matter bit : different venue , costume , musical arrangement , and bizarre visual concept be all use lend different texture and great deal upbeat humor what could have end up ' only ' concert film other hand . rich and full pack Born To BOOGIE be , film be only hour long , but what be there be totally satisfying . therein lie my only criticism--the video package state something 71 minute , and least one online source claim film be 67 minute , but apparently be more 61 minute rock fun .
movie be great mocumentary . follow rap group , NWH , make up Ice Cold , Tasty Taste and Tone Def their unique path gangster rap high , low and back high . trouble woman , ego , cop and whitey , group get top gangster rap world , movie go top mocumentaries . know everybodies favorite mocumentary be be Spinal Tap , very good reason , however think right mood , movie be simply good . laugh never end , even someone notrap culture.I be white guy , that have interest rap music , culture or anything else associate , however love movie . Rusty Cundeif , who write screenplay , song and star show great potential and be shame have n't see fear Black Hat . however , have see one more time have , and be , that recommend fear Black Hat quick laughs.Remember , " do n't shoot see white ! ... .of their eye ? do n't shoot see whites."FYM and enjoy movie .

have long be fan Peter Weir , have n't watch his Australian movie watch last Wave . and be pleasant , unpredictable surprise.Richard Chamberlain play David , lawyer invite defend five aborigine charge murder Aborigine . David 's peer be clear case drunken disorder and think should plead guilty and serve quick sentence . but David believe there be mystery murder , link tribal ritual . his investigation proceed learn notonly thing his client but about too.To reveal more would be spoil one strange movie have ever see . can only say movie go direction one will be expecting.There be many element that make fascinating movie : Chamberlain be act , instance ; but also performance David Gulpilil , who play young aborigine who introduce David tribal mystery ; and Nandjiwarra Amagula , who play old aborigine who be spiritual guide . relationship three character make heart movie.But there be also way Weir suggest supernatural movie . David have dream that warn future . Australia be undergo awful weather , storm , hail fall and even mysterious black rain that may be nothing more pollution . but be also relate case David be defend . how be related be one great revelation movie . out little event Weir manage create atmosphere dread and oppression , suggest future horror really show anything.Charles Wain 's score be fantastic , especially use didgeridoo . photography be also quite good . Russell Boyd , Weir 's longtime DP who win Oscar 2004 Master and Commander , depict dark , creepy world full mystery.I also find remarkable movie center aborigine , do n't turn indictment white culture or sappy celebration their tradition , Dances Wolves or last Samurai . movie be too clever be simplistic.Sometimes can be frustrating , and may upset viewer who expect finish movie everything make sense ; but who do n't mind strangeness or ambiguity , last Wave be great movie watch .

 Everything be relative seem be main theme outset set eleven piece eleven director . be say what might be number one priority people Bush , Blair and Company , may notbe so great many other people , ordinary people . opening scene which Iranian teacher be try impress her little student most important thing that have happen , result child be notimpress , death neighbour and thing like evidently affect much more closely anything which may have happen New York , USA , wherever be , series almost documentary style piece establish notthing be as equal man world leader would try prophess.Whereas , obviously , attack WTC be dastardly event yardstick , do get impression politician and TV cameraman tend blow up thing out proportion - wonderfully manifest one piece . would same reaction international level have occur attack have be make Lagos , say , or Djakarta , say , or even Rio de Janeiro , say ? rather think not. News seem suffer distortion depend where thing happen : much more TV time be give earthquake Italy , say , one ten time more destructive Outer Mongolia , say . great distance seem decrease magnitude disaster.This series eleven piece help put thing good perspective - or , perhaps should say , piece do , director complete freedom have make up his own story , his own translate perspective , such be notpossible judge whole merit , but individually eleven-minute segment.In way should deduce be anti-American film : that would be too simple reading diverse message manifest segment . however , be notpro-American either . eleven segment adopt varied attitude and common link - there be one - be disaster WTC attack have be see perspective different view-points . only then will such people George Bush even begin comprehend planet be live on.Clearly state one segment be belief mine have be harbour two year now : America have notlearn lesson . and lesson be USA have share planet rest humanity - notdominate ruthless economical persuasion or just plain force . instead learn USA can continue just stamp all everybody and everywhere , its political leader , aid and abet Blair ( and even Aznar ) have become even more arrogant and even more intolerant , which be notdo good anyone Afghanistan or Irak present , let alone much elsewhere . White House mentality be totally rejectable : US and UK invade Irak and cause all chaos , and so should clear up mess cause - notinsist UN and other nation delve help hand and thus find easy way out turmoil.Radical stance adopt US ( or even Israel ) be only go be meet radical stance Islamic people , who year have be gear up fanatical fundamentalism , only cover up their own macho uselessness , i.e. , stone woman death or simply shroud top their head dusty ground.The world be terrible mess , fuel greed few rich country who seem bent notsee or understand anything more multilateral perspective . film eleven separate piece accurately portray dismal and dumb posture .

nominate and Babylon 5 good television sci-fi series make . both stand out my mind early Star Trek series , there be consistent evolution plot and character . look original Star Trek and Star TREK:TNG , be fine show , but there be overall theme or plot that connect all episode . many way , could usually watch show totally out sequence difficulty understanding what be occur . be less case Deep Space 9 ( its giant battle that take up final season ) and other Trek show , there be more large story unify . coherence seem have develop concept Babylon 5 and see even great extent SG-1 . bottom line be many way series be watch family or long novel slowly take form . sure , there be few " throwaway " episode that be notconnect rest , but be very few and far and be also usually pretty funny.And speak funny , love SG-1 keep mood light time time and be n't so dreadfully serious . way , actually enjoy more Babylon 5 . Jack O'Neill be great character his sarcasm and love Homer Simpson--it be really too bad slowly fade series later seasons.To truly appreciate SG-1 , should watch beginning and see how intricately plot work . coherence give show exceptional stay power . and , do n't like SG-1 give fair chance , then sci-fi be probably notgenre .

Steven Spielberg produce , write , come up idea and even direct episode Amazing Stories , so naturally would have be great anthology ever right ? unfortunately wrong . episode be just fantastic , but all too often be mixed bag . fact , that might have be be downfall be be way too mixed . episode be light comedy , be dramas , be horror , and be even animate , which make this similar , but notgood 80s version Twilight Zone ( which also be around).Normally will have mixture story anthology show , but just do n't fully work here . more fantastical dramatic episode feel would be well be show late night Lifetime network , episode " Ghost Train " , which be direct Spielberg . episode , give message hope , and give fantasy story , but overall be just build up ending which do n't blow away anyways . horror episode tend work good drama , but there be far more dramatic one , and grow tire watch . act wise , anthology get big star , similar original Twilight Zone . Kevin Costner , Kiefer Sutherland , Milton Berle , Dom Deluise , Harvey Keitel , Beau Bridges , Charlie Sheen , Forrest Whitaker , Tim Robbins , John Lithgow , Rhea Perlman , Danny Devito , Patrick Swayze , Christopher Lloyd , June Lockhart , Kathy Baker , Weird Al Yankovich and many other well known have be episode show . be fun see well know actor almost episode series . great director have also have part episode include Spielberg , Clint Eastwood , Burt Reynolds , Bob Clark , Joe Dante , Mick Garris , Paul Bartel , Joe Dante , Robert Zemeckis , Danny Devito and even Martin Scorsese . will actually recommend more fan director and/or 80s anyone else.Amazing Stories be sometimes amazing , usually good , occasionally mediocre , and once real stinker come out . but , show have nostalgic value , and be sort fun sit boring afternoon and watch episode . John Williams ' theme music show be sure be catch anyone 's head who watch , too.My rating : good show . 30 min . episode . TVPG
 Pinjar be truly masterpiece ... . be thought provoke Film that make think and make question our culture . be doubt well Hindi movie have see date . film should have be show movie festival world and believe would have be serious contender Cannes . all character be perfectly cast and Urmila Matkondar and Manoj Bhajpai be haunt their roles.The story movie tell about partition be very very important story and one that should never be forgotten.It have bias or prejudice and have give partition human story . here , one country be depict good or bad . there be evil Indian , evil Pakistani and good Indian and Pakistani . cinematography be excellent and music be melodious , meaningful and haunting . everything movie be amazing ... and acting just take my breath away . be perfectly cast .
A lot be date episode ( just most Twilight Zone episode ) , such Woman 's incredibly sexist military " uniform . " and thing be so unbelievable , easy availability clean water . still , consider year be make and time , and quickly understand why episode be so special watch . have nice sense hope , something miss lot twilight zone , as well interesting female character ( fact rarely speak ) , something else rare Twilight Zone . " Two " be great example how Twilight Zone , just 20 minute , could pack more emotion and drama most two hour movie today . and be great see two people who become American icon so early their career .
first see film when be flip movie channel my parent DirecTV . be Sundance channel and be just start . love music , especially late 60s and be what BJM sound ( Dandys be alright ) . everything Brian Jonestown Massacre intrigue music , Anton and Joel 's personality , illicit drug use . be funny be watch first party scene when everyone be do line my parent walk and decide watch ( look their face be priceless ) . anyways be definitely one my favorite movie introduce Brian Jonestown Massacre who be now my favorite band time.just watch ... seriously
Director Douglas Sirk score again , grandaddy dysfunctional family film . lush , trashy saga be masterpiece , beautifully combine element Sirk 's soapers and strategically place all one movie . " write Wind " very obviously influence 1980s TV series " Dallas " and " Dynasty " , be basically feature-length version late nighttime soaps.Lauren Bacall , wonderfully and subtly , play Lucy Moore , New York City secretary who marry oil baron , Kyle Hadley ( Robert Stack ) . unbeknownst , Mitch Wayne ( Rock Hudson ) be also love quiet , but sexy secretary . all go back Kyle 's family be mansion Texas where meet his white trash slut-of-a-sister , Marylee ( Dorothy Malone Oscar-winning turn ) . Yipee ! spark begin fly - romance catfights , be campy trip . notonly do Mitch have fight feeling have his good friend 's wife , but Marylee try sleep everybody ca n't have her one true love who be Mitch . top off , Kyle learn be impotent , but somehow Lucy end up pregnant.This be pure soap and pure melodramatic entertainment . how can notlove ? film signal one Universal 's most popular film and one director Sirk 's good work . dialogue be absolutely sizzling and visual metaphor be throw which way - theme wind be great . cast be great , Bacall be completely underuse receive top-billing Hudson . Stack 's Oscar loss reportedly devastate . consider his fine performance and apparently be none too please lose out . and do turn out fabulous performance whimpering alcoholic . what stunning movie ! film prove what have be think age - Sirk be master classic melodrama . where be his Oscar ?
what overlook 80 's soundtrack . imagine John Travolta sing song but watch movie do seem personify everything that be 80s cheese . clearly movie that rely mechanical bull , bartender and immature relationship be style . good be his lousy Texas accent . compare Friday Night Lights.I suggest watch Cocktail and Stir Crazy start really get dumbing down film . also , side note make America Ted Danson and Whoopie Goldberg be awesomely bad movie . be so shock realize have never watch . One more weird movie genre would have include Cadilac Man Robin Williams . just remember Big star play big role CHEESY movies. . Tom Cruise , Richard Pryor , Robin Williams and John Travolta
Japanese Tomo Akiyama 's Keko Mask ( 1993 ) be extremely enjoyable trash film and so fun watch ! there be also sequel , but have n't see film be hyper rare . kind re-release day would be nice think many trash lover would like film . tongue cheek story be about one extremely strict school which teacher think be okay torture student order attain discipline , which be , accord teacher , most important thing education . school be lead incredibly funny look ( just look costume ! ) human wizard/whatever , who be principal school , and only add campiness be never explain why wear such costume other teacher be perfectly normally clothe . well , main thing film be its name , Keko Mask , who be beautiful and masked fairy , who come always save girl and student who be abuse and torture teacher ! yes , superheroine be one effective female kick and fight evil teacher totally cheesy soundtrack play background . most important thing be , course , that wear nothing but cape and mask rest her body naked ! her identity be never reveal film , and also credit say " Keko Mask : unknown " actor name be list ! most hilarious thing film be how Keko Mask kill her enemy . have gorgeous , but lethal vagina ! yes , read right . kill her victim fly air front , spread her leg and let enemy become numbly charm view , which fly closer and snap their neck her leg ! most usual last line character say film be : " have never see such beautiful vagina " and " now can die peace . " film be totally fantastic ! !There be also great taunt Japanese society example its attitude sex film ( Japanese censor optically fog/blur all pubic hair film ) and also restriction school student ( girl and boy be notallow talk film etc. ) there be one great scene which one nerd see girl 's bare you-know-what first time , and say " Hey there be fog ! " could n't help but laugh scene think what do Japanese censor think . also , one character say end will return , Japan Films allow make sequel . be glad allow have hear sequel be equally outrageous . One sequel should include Blues Brothers ( yes , THOSE Blues Brothers ! ) etc.This be trash its most enjoyable , funny and also clever form and so be little shame film be so hard find . would definitely be even great experience , be little more fast move time become little boring one point , but fortunately segment be very few . film have be see be fully believe there be so many trash element do n't mention here and would n't be even necessary tell all here . trash cinema and film make tongue very cheek , think will love little gem do , and director be definitely genius field ! positive perhaps only film which shine vagina be lethal ?

have buy , " feast Saints , " and be nottruly horrible movie , but lot thing could have be good . have lot historical value , play out very talented actress/actors , and be noteveryday occurrence actor can play out such role and have be somewhat believable . there be part that be little mediocre and confusing , but would n't say entire movie be horrible . once think about , capture @card@ 's New Orleans , and make something out , pretty hard , and much harder get actor who can strongly signify part . but only big problem have movie be most actor who do play free people color , be mostly light skinned African , notvery universal cast other who be n't light skinned ; one old Creole stereotype that still exist . whomever do casting could have pick wide variety when come hue , many Creole be color conscious.Rather pick actor that look near white sense , could have be more think out.The actor do great job , script could have well write , and overall find performance be very believable .
good Treasure Island ever make . just do n't make filmslike anymore , or ever . one make film .

Robert Blake be excellent his portrayal Perry Smith . book be also excellently write Truman Capote .
finally sit down and see film whole way , and must say , be very impress . Michelle Rodriguez be probably one my new favorite actresses---it be notonly fact *can* act , but choose role well suit be more meaningful and important what would first seem . have read few comment express their relief be notawful feminist thing think beforehand , but certainly disagree . Diana be feminist . follow her dream and believe contrary what practically everyone her think ( exception her caring brother Tiny and her trainer and manager , Hector , who prove be more father figure her real parent ) , which be what word " Feminism " be all about . be good see film showcase true side feminism--that be notbunch manhating losers--but have dream and can do anything . Diana be true still fall prey love , and and Adrian have more realistic , complicated relationship rather just something that magically work out . Girlfight be true taste reality and put faith back my perception people . thanks , Michelle.positive - very important movie that be relatable notjust young woman , but everyone want go far their life .

could notagree more quote " be one good film ever make . " think Vanilla Sky be simply " re-make , " could notbe more wrong . there be tremendous depth film : visually , musically , and emotionally.Visually , film be soft and delicate time ( early scene Sofia ) and other time powerful and intense ( Times Square , post-climactic scenes).The music and sound tie movie so perfectly . music , story be only half tell . Nancy Wilson create emotional , yet eclectic , score film which could notbe more suitable such dream-like theme ( never release , be able get my hand original score about $60 . look hard , may be able find copy ) . Crowe 's other musical selection , such Beach Boys , Josh Rouse , Spiritualized , Sigur Ros , Monkees , etcetera etcetera , be also perfect fit film ( Crowe have ear great music).More importantly , emotional theme film ( i.e. love , sadness , regret ) be very powerful , and be amplify tenfold visual and musical experience , as well ingenious dialogue ; admit , elevator scene bring tear my eye time and time again.The good part film however ( as could get any good ) be be so intelligently craft such time see film , will catch something new--so watch closely , and be prepare think ! sure , theme become obvious first or second watch , but there be always more story think.This be easily Cameron Crowe 's good work , and altogether work brilliance . much my film-making and musical inspiration come work alone . have honestly touch my life , true art have tendency do . continually surprise there be many people that can appreciate film what be ( guess understand true art be art itself).Bottom line : vanilla sky be league its own .

Personal taste rule when come talk movie such treasure little gem . way back eighty , early eighty , i discover movie , so many release time , " Night Patrol " " Bad Manners " or even " King Frat " artwork and blurb back cover tempt and tease you.Of course be age , movie like i have already mention as well stuff " screwball " and many other , capture imagination , and thankfully many year late i still remember fondness and disdain many movie that help maintain my love such genre parody or pastiches.Made many year huge success " Animal House " and have see how have fare down year , now know there would be way movie would ever eclipse box office buck obtain aforementioned nor would linger memory , much National Lampoon 's Vacation.To be honest , noteverything that have carry National Lampoon Logo have be wild success , however me Class Reunion remain one my time favourite movie , instantly recognisable character , such aloof Bob Spinnaker play perfection Gerrit Graham , so good Charles Band 's " Terrorvision " still linger past glory his youth . or how about Stephen Furst 's brash and ballsy turn high school lazy drunken sex craze bum Hubert Downs.Sweet as . which make ponder . i already say , personal taste notwithstand . people can be so cruel , so will never win award or be compare like its 's peer comedy world . do have merit . be one early script pen John Hughes , who would later go do one my own favourite his work " Weird Science " as well have wonderful theme title sing great Gary U.S Bonds.What more can i say , be movie just wait be rediscover , time and time again .
only see show few time , but will live my memory.It be very frustrating be so difficult find anywhere purchase and yet there seem be endless repeat stuff friend ! especially even more difficult obtain be England I guess. . ? say be low rating or be complaint Bakersfield PD ? maybe be just too clever certain people ? anyhow , just one comedy would love see again but be almost impossible find . hear be being or have be repeat network ? but alas nothere ! !Summary : ingenious .

Jay Chou remain pretty much expressionless , but such be his style , and when do let emotion flicker can be quite good comic effect .

Domino be great movie . be about young woman name Domino Harvey ( Kiera Knightley ) who become bounty-hunter her boredom her lifestyle . join two fellow hunter ( Mickey Rourke & Edgar Ramirez ) and adventure begin . script be good . very down-to-earth and realistic tone film . only problem have movie be concentrate different thing do , instead character Domino.Even , Kiera Knightley give fierce performance . show right amount anger and dedication performance . Mickey Rourke follow up his Oscar-Worthy performance ' Sin City ' tough-guy performance . Edgar Ramirez really do n't do anything speak Spanish once while and stare Kiera . Delroy Lindoi give good supporting performance . Mo'Nique be , do surprise one particular scene . Lucy Liu have great chemistry Kiera Knightley her scene her.The good thing movie though , be direction . Tony Scott 's fast-paced style really bring movie life . cinematography be good , have ever see . take regular movie and put acid . all black be black , white be bright , and have sort green glow . action scene be exhilarating.OVERALL : like Sin City & Man Fire , will like Domino .
will keep short and brief , people who write story line show be genius , actor be just perfect role play ( CJ 's character be legendary ) and have so much chemistry screen which make what be , very successful comedy.When i see first see new episode which be probably go back just 6/7 month , i wonder what have happen Paul . be gut find out have die when i browse Google . be so funny and play his character perfection , over-protective dad , who like keep his daughter out limelight and away boys.The comedy , i think , have go strength strength , even Paul it.Plus , i think most people would enjoy watch .

Lugosi be more up task make enjoyable film , however , movie suffer ultra-wooden acting Co star Luana Walters and Tristram Coffin . Coffin ( nice name guy horror flick ) be especially bad case . have see numerous movie and tv show and be always same ; stiff , wooden and utterly unconvincing . Miss Walters be only slightly good , but too lack act talent make her role believable . still , viewer can enjoy great Lugosi act yet dastardly scheme only be foil end ! poor acting , " Corpse Vanishes " be enjoyable movie see .
be surprise how fascinating movie be . performance be extremely good , especially Rea compassionate no-nonsense detective.Despite low budget , big FX or flashy camerawork , Citizen X somehow manage surpass majority similar big Hollywood film just . tell . . Story.True story tend end whimper rather bang , and be case here , but apart , be highly recommend detective yarn .

New York , 1953 . One hot night , four famous iconic figure will come together . professor ( Albert Einstein ) have come NY give speech , which have , senator ( Joesph MacCarthy ) his back . later night his get surprise visitor ; famous actress ( Marilyn Monroe ) . who actually want discuss theory relativity . soon her ball-playing husband ( Joe DiMaggio ) turn up hotel room , beg work thing out their crumble relationship . flashback childhood , important event , perceive consequence their action creep show how individual cope despair and hidden fear wait break out.Now that be one-of-a-kind ! adapt stage-play Terry Johnson ( who would also script screenplay film ) , " Insignificance " be odd , quirky , seductive and downright curious fictional pop-culture gimmick hand director Nicolas Roeg . inspired and cerebral experimental effort might be root its stage-play origin , do feel theatrical and most action occur hotel backdrop and one main suite . cramp look only enhance moody and smoky atmosphere New York great effect . however limitation ca n't contain fruitful and daring idea that Roeg manage randomly storm up visually and meaningful material . way reflect character ' ( who be suggestively famous figure , need name ) philosophical journey and interpretation their notion be stimulate spiritual sense , memory gell present and vision show their fear realisation , which depend what be see be either beautiful , or hauntingly implement . there be plenty food thought and hint verbosely innovative ( sometimes awkward ) script , main focus concern present situation , but flashback give personal make-up ( sex , power , enlightenment and glory ) what make who be and how much burden can be there already demand life . sure story might notlead anything end , and can feel disjointed , but dreamy vibe and intelligent arrangement iron fold and make sure never turn giddy . Peter Hannan 's sensually fluid photography and Stanley Myers ' titillatingly ooze blue soundtrack fit snugly Roeg 's stylistically subdue and established style directing . make look be work something big and large-scale , but otherwise that be notcase and small little universe be create . vintage costume and location period all come off fittingly enough . what make film have be impressive acting boast main four . Theresa Russell 's perky , drop dead gorgeous appeal sexy pin-up actress be grow portrayal that definitely hold film together along genuinely excellent and endear performance Michael Emil professor . Tony Curtis marvellously play up witch-hunting senator and Gary Busey be suitably good stoically gravel manner ballplayer . show up minor , but amusing support role happen be Will Sampson and Patrick Kilpatrick.A memorably striking , fresh and tour de force meditation piece metaphysic link together four different extreme . might find pretentiously estrange and too talky , but one have wrap up its own little unique world worry too much its shortcoming .
 Cannot believe movie that can be make good 1987 and be virtually unknown west . notrepeat other review here . score be very good and move . literally mean " Dawn please never come " - when come , beautiful ghost and lover will be apart forever . 24 year , Joel and Leslie still look great . enjoy Joel God Gamblers and many movie Leslie include Better Tomorrow .
my case like movie when see find more expect . mean , be one few animated movie that make think its theme even long finish . talk death , vengeance and hell such way get punch your face , even reach suffer dream sequence mid-point film . be what make movie so good : ability , unique Don Bluth ( director ) , play people 's feeling and make love or hate character time . , and fact have so many good character Charlie and Ann-Marie , that sad but happy end have say " have something my eye " hide other cry . all have say be just only good point movie . as rest , have see film extremely honest . Don Bluth , thank .
give 10 , everyone else seem like and would have be churlish not. reason be trouble be add personal observation Castle 's work.I have see " homicidal " and " Tingler " ( version clever colour sequence where everything blood be black and white ) few time and " House Haunted Hill " many times.Even be notold enough have see when Castle be up his showman trick , thus can appreciate their own merit . and most pass off second-rate , schlocky , hammy , etc. , believe do disservice.The end sequence " Homicidal " be genuinely shocking and work today - and premise " Tingler " silly , be highly original.But " House Haunted Hill " be TRIUMPH . have use Frank Lloyd Wright house its exterior , great Vincent Price and solid cast , plus good score and production value - when first see packed late-night showing late sixty , produce audience reaction have notsee before and have notsee since.It be bit where heroine be alone basement ( have notsee film , stop read now ) and be wait hear hero other side wall.With No telegraph what be come , camera slowly pull back , force audience switch their gaze ... be say no more ( my " spoiler " declaration only cover This movie).The point be , believe ploy be deliberate - notaccidental - and when happen , WHOLE AUDIENCE SCREAMED ( include most man ! ) take audience Ten Minutes calm down.Now THAT be superior film-making . flamboyant showman might have be , but " House " and other two film have mention be Good MOVIES . Castle may nothave be Hitchcock , but be Ed Wood , either.It be easy concentrate someone 's quirk and forget examine their talent . so hope documentary acknowledge that . look forward see .
Sherman , set wayback machine ... @card@ . United States be just climb out its bad postwar recession , Japan be enjoy unprecedented industrial boom . manufacturing industry be still significant part US economy , and factory worker be good example " average American " . word " downsizing " have n't enter general vocabulary yet , but everyone know phenomenon . Bruce could be hear radio singing , " Foreman say job be go , boy , and ai n't come back your hometown . " Chrysler have just be bail out Uncle Sam . bumper sticker could be see say " buy American -- job save may be your own.""Gung Ho " do good job capture mood American industrial workforce just other popular movie make period . certainly movie have its flaw -- loose plot thread and mediocre act job everyone Michael Keaton and Gedde Watanabe . but story really be about meeting East and West : Keaton 's Hunt Stevenson personify America , brash and confident outside yet insecure underneath . Watanabe 's Kazuhiro personify Japan , top heap successful system , but wonder there be more be learn their Western rival . movie 's plot , flaw be , simply provide framework conflict , and eventually synthesis , their two personalities.Keaton 's acting overshadow everyone else be , and practically make movie . have always admire Keaton his ability deliver line that feel improvise , matter what script be follow . his character , Hunt Stevenson , be likable , affable everyman , natural leader wise-ass streak . but have fatal flaw common many : do n't want disappoint anyone . will distract crowd inspirational anecdote , and even lie , rather point ugly truth.Kazuhiro be mirror image Stevenson : shy and introspective , but also , his Japanese upbringing , reluctant be bearer bad news . scene which Stevenson first come Kazuhiro employee ' grievance capture perfectly Japanese approach workplace conflict . Kazuhiro reply Stevenson 's complaint " understand what be say , " but wo n't refuse his request out loud . Stevenson misinterpret agreement , and go away say , " Okay , have get settle . " ( be still problem Japanese-American business relation 21st century ! )Ultimately , Kazuhiro and Stevenson have same problem : get factory work smoothly , meet production goal , and fulfill their responsibility worker . work goal , have take page other ' book . Kazuhiro 's family become more " Americanize " be obvious example . also note Stevenson think be odd when Kazuhiro explain how have make public apology his worker fail -- and yet , later movie , Stevenson do exactly himself.The plot and its resolution be little cornball , but hey , be comedy . can overlook movie 's flaw , there be great story self-realization and open-mindedness here .
Well , when before see film really be n't sure would be my cup tea ... how wrong be ! think be one good film have watch very long time , real family classic . story young evacuee and his new ' foster ' dad , film tick all box . have notread book ( maybe be good thing & mean enjoy film more ) but regard story , really ca n't think bad point , hence score 10 10 ( and hardly ever think anything warrant top mark ! ) . time William proclaimed ' I Can RIDE My Bike , Dad ! ' be sob my heart ( anyone who have see will understand , be sure ) . really heartwarming , and definitely recommend .
NB : spoiler . great movie be " about " many thing , all successfully : sci-fi time travel , unstable psychology , dystopian society , what-is-real syndrome , gradual undermine belief system , worldwide bioterrorism , and nascent love story.The ramification story 's twisted time line stir up load heated debate - witness discussion site ; or , extreme , check out dissertation www.mjyoung.net/time/monkeys.html . Whew ! such temporal emphasis speak mostly brilliant plot , come magnificent work writer David and Janet Peoples , notmention inspiration Chris Marker 's " La Jetee .

" Twelve Monkeys " be intelligent , provocative , bizarre , funny , and suspenseful stuff.The support cast be excellent , especially Brad Pitt steal his scene and show great flexibility Jeffery Goines , craze and spoil , but ever survivor . and there be David Morse Dr. Peters ( interesting how movie simply leave viewer his wicked motivation ) and Christopher Plummer Dr. Goines . but big accolade belong Terry Gilliam , surpass here - just barely - his outstanding " Brazil . " ( lot parallel , course , especially lonely combatant try escape his crumble surroundings : lunacy , lunacy . ) Every frame movie have his unique stamp and tone . soundtrack be terrific , too.This be one great achievement 90s , true favorite mine , and sure hold up long time come .

mystery here be why delightful , small comedy have be ignore most critic and have fail find audience deserve . simply showcase budding talent Audrey Tautou should be enough generate great recognition cognoscenti.Lacking pretension and rely quirky characterization , its rumination interconnection human behavior manage be amusing and life affirm and , its more critically acclaimed competition genre , such taste other , actually entertain .
Carlos Mencia be excellent be hour special . be work hard show everybody be real deal . know people have say be stolen material special , but be nottrue .

" Night live Homeless " be fairly strong finish first half Season 11 . obviously parody various zombie movie , most notably Dawn Dead , episode parallel homeless live dead , creature who feed and thrive off spare change rather brains.Kyle be blame sudden mass outbreak homeless people when , out goodness his heart , give $20 homeless man front his house . more homeless people begin infiltrate South Park , town be completely overrun . be very strong Randy Marsh episode , assume role shotgun-wielding leader adult who take refuge roof Park County Community Center . but Randy make community center , be accost hundred homeless people hilariously scream " do n't have change ! !

review liken troupe cross Monty Python and Twin Peaks , also aptly . yet review expound difference comedy enjoy non-critically and black comedy , also well worth consideration.Watch whole thing , three series . end , all character be tie up and puzzle piece fall place just as well Douglas Adams novel . detail and intricacy be staggering . thoroughly post-modern . wickedly funny , and startlingly tragic . notkid . notthin skin or who lack objectivity . thought-provoking . once literal , figurative , and surreal disturbing way . black comedy can recall.And very possibly most wonderful thing will ever see .
comment film make sound lousy . give talking picture be so new - think script and acting be good . Davis be so young and fresh . have notyet find her own style have grow expect . yet be great see way - still learn craft.So many clichs come film and seem , film blaze trail next 70 year . my vote be see and remember how young type film be . keep and open mind and maybe shock how troubled character be picture , be 1934 and how view early part last century uptight. . love and hope make up your own mind notinfluence other negative and one note comment .
Running only seventy-two minute , small , overlook 2006 dramedy be really just two-character sketch piece but one that work very well its limitation . take place almost entirely various , non-descript spot southern Los Angeles , story be inconsequential , but Sofia Coppola 's " Lost translation " , film be far more two stranger who meet unexpectedly , find common bond and go back their life enlighten momentous encounter . also help considerably Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega be play character . finally free wise sage and authority figure reproach that have become his big-screen specialty , Freeman seem comparatively liberated somewhat self-indulgent movie star . his character be drive low-rent grocery store Carson , where will be able research role be consider indie film.Out work few year , be embarrassed when see DVDs his film bargain bin , but his ego be such do notlack temerity watch and even mimic enervate store staff . particular fascination be Scarlet , embitter worker Spain and relegate express line where be unsung model efficiency . have interview secretarial job construction company , but her deep-seeded insecurity seem defeat her chance already . still look Penelope Cruz 's Amazonian sister , beautiful Vega ( one few redeemable aspect James L. Brooks ' execrable " Spanglish " ) bring stinging edge and realistic vulnerability Scarlet . and Freeman interplay very well story , which include stop notonly grocery store but also Target , Arby 's and full-service carwash . nothing earth-shattering happen show how two people realize resonate transience chance encounters.Silberling keep proceeding simple , but production also reflect expert craftsmanship Phedon Papamichael 's vibrant cinematography ( lensed Alexander Payne 's " Sideways " ) and infectious score Brazilian composer Antonio Pinto ( " City God " ) . there be fast cameo Bobby Cannavale ( Scarlet 's soon-to-be-ex-husband ) and , Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman , as well funny bit Jonah Hill ( " Knocked Up " ) clueless driver and Jim Parsons ( " knight " " Garden State " ) worshipful receptionist . 2007 DVD be overstuff extra , include making-of documentary , " 15 Days or Less " , aim film student and run marathon 103 minute ; six extended scene ; light-hearted but insightful three-way conversation Silberling , Freeman and Vega middle Target ; and couple snippet that specifically advertise DVD .
First , Riget be wonderful . good comedy and mystery thriller same time . nice combination strange ' dogma ' style tell story together good music and great actor . but unfortunately there be no ' end ' . as be unacceptable . be think ... how will be possible continue story Helmer and Drusse ? ... and have idea . think Lars should make RIGET III little bit different . be sure 3rd part Helmer would n't be same . so here be my suggestion . Mayble little bit stupid , maybe not. know Lars like experiment . so why notmake small experiment Riget3 ? think only solution here be create puppet-driven animation ( example " team America " Trey Parker ) or even computer 3d animation . know be notsame real actor , but principle believe could work ... only way be possible make actor alive again . Riget fan should n't be so big difference - animation will be do good way average ' watcher ' will consider normal just first few shot movie . most important thing now be story . be completely understandable be notpossible create Riget 3 actor nowadays . so why notplay animation ? and ... look possibility give ! even market one ! great director finish his trilogy 10 year use puppet animation . just dream ? hope see Riget 3 someday ... or even see just script . be curious how story end ... and expect- everybody here do.greets , slajps : be nottalk " kingdom hospital " Stephen King ; - )

Landon also have Highway Heaven and Little House Prarie where have creative control . Little Joe be young , most hot head , but most romantic Cartwrights.When Roberts leave . show keep go two young son , but when big Dan Blocker leave , heart go out Bonanza . other character have be add time , David Canary , Tim Matheson , and Ben Cartwright adopt young Mitch Vogel . but big , loyal , but little thick Hoss be easily most lovable Cartwrights . his sudden demise surgery leave too big hole that family.So Cartwrights Ponderosa have pass history . get real taste how America take Cartwrights heart when visit real Virginia City . do n't look anything what see Bonanza . but Lake Tahoe , just about where see Ponderosa map opening credit , be Cartwright home , set maintain and open tourist attraction . 21 Baker Street Sherlock Holmes fan , ranchhouse and Cartwrights be real.And be n't real , should have be .

feel film be rare treasure . notonly be beginning Shirley Temple 's career , but rare look how our society have change . have understand , certain thing today would view as sexual , back then would be consider innocent . example , parent child film as well many parent who take their child see movie , see as just child mimick adult . most people do n't think anyone viewing child sexually attractive , other teenage boy lust teenage girl . be n't sexual . mind be have Internet , TV , etc ... most sex crime be n't openly bring up . occasionally there would be whisper kid " funny uncle . " but be often that come . yes very sad . but be kinda sad today , even too can see film anything other what be intend , innocent and funny . when see Shirley dance that and boy eye ball , yes feel disturb . have remind time take place ! child do n't know what sex be . parent know , both child movie and watch . thought may nothave even enter their mind . eye average adult back then , be more sexual then Shirley be play house . even today kid will enter beauty contest , many dress up extremely maturely , three Yr old . however child be merely pretend . do n't blame child want act adult . or old movie that display . honesty , our medium have make lot thing seem back then seem sick and wrong . sometimes can be good . but truly believe movie be n't one . give rare look innocent mentality , that have long lose .
This be good film 99 % duration . feel ending have occlude film high acclaim.It be shoot rather naive fashion . be clearly do create more chilling feel film - feeling isolation become apparent very soon due film technique.The gruesome character be very well act and present especially ' nutcase ' call Joe . however , wholesome ( normal ) character be little too pathetic my liking - grant , be suppose come across pathetic but be do little OTT.The film start slowly ( and naive camera work smack ' B ' movie start ) and very normally but soon get feel impending brutality that be about occur . be one most ' twist ' movie respect cold-hearted violence.After abrupt and unbelievably lazy end be leave feel disappointed . would have give film 9 end be keep rest film but as be get only 7 strength ' eeriness ' and nail-biting scene earlier film.Give watch and excuse ending !
Hal Hartley 's Henry Fool be independent film masterpiece and certainly his good work . have immense character depth , subtle , complicated dialogue , and excellent , emotional ending which captivate . remember pause several time my first viewing absorb what be see and feel . Henry Fool be complete movie start finish , and need sequel.Thus be surprise when hear Fay Grim . Fay be notone main character first film and seem exist more troubling imposition real-world vanity and ignorance her brother Simon be force deal mature . her own movie , Fay mature , her maturity take very different road . Simon go near autistic isolation merely somewhat-introverted genius . Fay start her adult journey immature , utterly normal , spoiled child and respond onslaught ridiculous circumstance become mature , utterly normal , experienced adult who hold advantage . deal problem way human do , determination , little thought , and weary disdain . Simon learn control his mind , Fay learn control her emotion.The movie contain several fondly remember element its prequel , but differ vastly tone most film . Henry fool show harsh , boring , ignorant world which contrast Simon 's inner passion and creativity . Fay Grim , world be lively , crazy , emotional place which show silliness her young life , and contrast unearth inner wise woman which have notbe previously develop or nurture her similarly weak mother.The movie be two part , first dealing beginning Fay 's struggle and subsequent hardening due authoritarian hostility , and second dealing her battle soften only just enough regain Henry . first , fan Henry Fool may find wonder how movie can even be consider sequel , and think be profane follow such intense film spy game antic and physical comedy . but be where subtlety Fay Grim lie . sequel be about Fay 's journey , and say before , be one find life-giving sanity chaos , notcreative chaos staid order . Parker Posey be excellent actress who capture Hal Hartley 's tongue cheek humor perfectly . Elina Lwensohn perhaps eclipse emotional commitment role , allow Parker play straight man and comic lively , stage-like comedy happen her.With entrance Henry picture , movie begin take sobering turn . Hal Hartley 's movie be play , and play must come full circle . end , be show Fay 's newly develop character and integrity be offspring her time fatally intense Henry , whose piercing honesty and unique passion light spark anyone meets.Fay Grim be excellent movie which do notsurpass Henry Fool , but show Hal 's range nuance his art be proof his genius.Honestly , think anyone who bash movie notonly miss point mile ( and especially subtlety Parker Posey be act ) , but could nothave be much interested movie Henry Fool .
love movie , but ca n't get what be movie tht be notlike . people who do n't like movie must be Richard Roeper and Roger Ebert . but ca n't believe that be Mr. Carrey all makeup . and be sure most actor and actress movie have make film . and there be new face movie .

but rest , who love good sentimental and emotional story that be lock get crying..enjoy ! Tom Hulce be magnificent Dominick , mentally slow trashman who love professional wrestling and his brother , Eugene , play Ray Liotta , who be doctor and who work very long hours.Due Eugene 's work schedule , Dominick be alone lot time and tend make questionable judgment call . really just want be good boy , do right thing , and make his brother proud . stop church pray one point and express his emotion so openly and so well character have cry damn movie even get really started.Not about give anything away here , but movie be extremely involve and sad and heartbreaking . unafraid thing will have field day beautiful story , its loving character and great song can quote here , that have nothing do movie all but be strangely appropriate..but hear bar.I think Tom Hulce would be nominate movie , be ' Amadeus ' figure that might give inside track actually winning . such luck . Liotta be just as good but have less emotional impact , but then do later on . all can say Jamie Lee Curtis be do n't have much part here but be nice lend her name small drama set Pittsburgh two brother who will never forget .
The Unborn be very , very different film . James Karen & Brooke Adams be film and perform quite well . film be build up solidly and keep go . think must be horror fan watch scene and plot . there be one brief sex scene nudity that could have be leave out and people scene may disappoint someone that be film and think stuff ruin good film but be when come . there be scene where Adams ' character go nut and kill cat but can tell its notreal . music be very different but very good . Unborn my opinion be really creepy film that be superbly unpredictable and that be quite strange ! recommend horror fan movie !

Blindsight be documentary group blind Tibetan teenager who attempt climb one Mount Everest 's sister peak . now , kind thing be usually ca n't miss . inspirational . move . pretty standard , right ? and even film be just that , will still have like . but be so much more . blind , German Sabriye Tenberken establish school blind child Tibet , culture that see blindness curse , evidence person do bad thing previous life . many child school have be shun their whole life , and good , be burden their family . part their education , Tenberken share story American Erik Weihenmayer , first blind person reach summit Mount Everest . send letter invite come and visit her student . instead , come up plan . will arrange expedition climb 23,000 foot Lhakpa Ri and provide all guide and equipment . Sabriye find six willing participant and be when fun starts.Erik 's team be mostly American , mostly male , and mostly sight . experienced mountaineer , be Type-A personality , very gung-ho and goal-oriented . Sabriye be European , female , and blind , and student be more " project , " matter how well-intentioned . additionally , student be Tibetan , and notold enough or confident enough always stand up . expedition unfold , become pawn two adult " side , " want please , same time want gain confidence that come accomplishment . additional obstacle ( other be blind , that be ) , be speak English second or most case , third language , and struggle understand and make understood.When turn out none student have climb experience , and be much more coordinate other , begin unravel Erik 's original plan all reach summit together . student and teacher begin suffer effect high altitude , decision must be make continue on or send mountain . effect high altitude be increase irritability , and can see how feed conflict adult . risk oversimplify , one side be whom destination be , and other be who just want enjoy journey . wo n't tell how all turn out , say be one most surprising and thought-provoking story have see long time.The film also weave bit climber 's story narrative , and be sorely need , once climb , kid tend keep their head down and their mouth shut . all drama go , that be n't surprising . backstories be turn charming and heartbreaking , and find very strange find close tear beginning film end . be contrary my expectation , and pleasant surprise.In addition human drama cover , director Walker and her small crew have contend frigid and oxygen-deprived condition , lug equipment mountain and hope would n't break down . as great documentary , filmmaker be just lucky enough ( or smart enough , or prepare enough ) be right place right time , and have capture very special story that have as much say people who want do " what be good kid " do kid .

actually like movie very , very much . notit`s plot , act , joke , no . like , it`s one bad movie ever create . It`s so lame , so bad , become terribly funny . joke be actually cool , but rest make pray unemployment scriptwriter . " man white " be so dumb and stupid , can do only two thing . turn TV off or roll floor laugh ( beer help lot : ) . choose second option .
movie be very underrate . be highly imaginative , creative and clever . be just plain fun and my opinion film top first one . but film be forget when first come out , and become even more overlook year pass . " Bill & Ted 's Bogus Journey " also bomb box office , first one be pretty good hit and very popular.I think problem may be film be just release couple year too late . 1991 , Bill and Ted already seem " so ' 80s " . even ' 80s be only couple year ago back time , landscape music and style kid have change so radically gangsta rap , hip hop , Pearl Jam , Nirvana , grunge and Seattle sound . Bill and Ted their Ozzy Osbourne , Van Halen and Guns N ' Roses music their ' 80s style seem so out place and very outdate ' 91 , and think that have one Big reason film bomb box office . nobody but surfer be still say stuff " excellent ! " and " bogus ! " 1991 . " gremlin 2 " which also come out early ' 90s suffer similar fate be good film that bomb box office be too associate ' 80s . transition ' 80s the ' 90s be much faster change then now ' 90s and ' 00s . 1991 be nothing 1988 or 1989 , right now , 2002 and last year 2001 still looks/looked 1995 or 1996.If only " excellent adventure " which be make 1988 , be release THAT Year instead 1989 , and " Bogus Journey " be make quickly and release 1989 , then too would have probably be just as wildly receive first .
I one be glad see Jim Carrey film where being top be n't goal . his character be . want more - good thing happen and expect God deliver.Morgan Freeman make great God . sense humor and genuine sense love yet ready take little vacation when opportunity present itself.I think Jennifer Aniston 's character be little too vulnerable and understanding Carry 's basically self-center TV anchorman wanna-be but be way be written.I think preview ruin several potentially very funny scene everyone who see know what be come happened.I have read number review and seem people be look little too deep . be summer comedy and be notmean solve problem world there be few message could all take heart.A funny film .
sci-fi masterpiece have too many flaw editor have butcher its opening 1936 . visually be wonder behold , but script allow too many intellectual speech war and progress.This get very corny when actor be give recite lot high minded message times.Raymond Massey and Cedric Hardwicke,both great actors,come off quite pair fanatic . Ralph Richardson be very good " Boss " megalomaniac warlord . prediction World War II be very eerie consider world be brink most devastating conflict human history time . be sure glad war do n't turn out do movie . there be visually stunning montage sequence bridge leap time movie 's different episode . its notas entertaining hope would be,this movie stick your mind long have see .
Buddy be entertaining family film set time when " humanize " animal , and make cute be accept way get people be interested them.Based true story , Buddy show great love main character have animal and other , and will do anything other.While notperfect movie , animated gorilla be quite lifelike most time and mayhem that occur home be usually amusing children.This film miss opportunity address mistake bring wild animal home pet , but do show difficulties.A recommend film which be first Jim Henson Productions .
 Rawhide be wonderful TV western series . focus band trail drover lead trail boss Gil Favor . most episode - especially first 3 season be really character study Favor and his man . guest star come and go but Wagon Train seldom dominate episode appear . rawhide be true , gritty western and Gil Favor stand out memorable character never be forget . thanks Eric Fleming 's performance show become massive hit . course be ably support wonderful cast good actor - Clint Eastwood , Sheb Wooley , Paul Brinegar , Steve Raines , James Murdoch , Rocky Shahan , Robert Cabal . actor leave their mark piece television history . rawhide capture flavour time west other series have , as yet anyhow , manage do so . late season tend split lead and give individual story line . time do n't work - cattle drive and regular provide good story . however there be still classic story and Rawhide remain top drawer affair . black and white photography add bleak , realistic feel other western series seldom manage capture . rustler , Indians,Commancheroes , beautiful damsel distress , serial killer , all show up give our hero problem . end come series quietly when final season be axe less way through . reason - Eric Fleming have depart and Rawhide be now head body - gritty realism be go , Gil Favor command respect and exude authority - be never infallible and make all more interesting . shall notsee his like again . watch episode whenever can , seldom disappoint .
Henry Thomas be " great " . his character hold my attention . be so " " story forget be n't real . want keep baby and see what special person be . other people story be essential makeup his character . way band together help be truly awe inspiring . love movie that show real side human emotion have hit head , that be notsmart enough figure thing out .

This , " Prodigal Son " and " Eastern Condors " be my favourite Sammo Hung film . Fat Dragon be fat outing be " Condors " , but be no less sure-footed director or actor . be , fact , top his form and deliver devastating , brutal actioner that boast half dozen amazing sequence and manage tell compassionate , sweet love story also . love and romance be notdirector 's priority here , but serve curious adjunct action , and insure viewer do n't hit fast-forward button physical clashes.The opening scene , which feature funny light sabre duel , set solid but deceptive tone . sequence which Sammo 's pedicab be chase car be beautifully stage and sweeten sharp , comic tone . fast and furious stick fight Sammo and Lau Kar Leung be model dazzling choreography and sharp , superb direction , and easily one good ever its type . film 's violence escalate slowly , finally , when climactic showdown come , be subject most brutal altercation ever see Sammo production . director/actor 's assault Billy Chow and house fill angry , menace opponent be bone-cracking , physically punish delight.Terrific level and one well martial art movie ever made.Great score , too .

see ' New York : I Love You ' today and love ! be really look forward see watch ' Paris Je t'aime ' and overall think like one much good ... perhaps need watch ' Paris Je t'aime ' again do n't know ... read few review here NY:ILY and yes , movie be notits fault . when be pay tribute city New York - can get rather overwhelming and nothing seem fair enough do city due justice ... so elaborate film 's shortcoming , will just write about what liked.Unlike ' Paris Je t'aime ' which director 's short film be properly segment and title , NY:ILY be n't and many reviewer over here have find seamlessness story and overlap character here annoy and even confusing . think otherwise . love how story just flow one other and especially like overlapping character - might be gimmicky be do so often film now . but still like do n't find force . and idea be all connect end have wistful , even whimsical quality - which some might find corny but find beautiful.I like all film but one that touch most be one Yvan Attal Robin Wright Penn and Chris Cooper . be so well-act and script reveal end - again notunused past - bring tear and be cry segment that follow . always like Wright Penn and now be also fan Chris Cooper . precious initial few second when be stand alone restaurant , just get call - speak volume Cooper 's ability convey character just be there say anything.Most story film involve character who be either meet first time or have meet other just recently exception 4-5 story which character have know other long time . seem ( and might be wrong ) story be different but be all try drive home point , need even , just step back and view new light people and thing have know our life long time ; see people and thing eye stranger and appreciate just do when meet and see first time.The other film like be one Shunji Iwai Orlando Bloom and Christina Ricci , Natalie Portman Carlos Acosta and Taylor Geare , Brett Ratner Anton Yelchin and Olivia Thirlby , Shekhar Kapur Julie Christie , Shia LaBeouf and John Hurt and once again one Yvan Attal Ethan Hawke and Emilie Ohana when be caf . really need see more work Yvan Attal seem like lot ! overall , watch movie open mind . do n't read review watch ! might notlive up your expectation what movie and love New York should be and doubt movie will really live up conception . just watch movie good music , beautiful landscape cinematography , slice-of-life comfort and story or two that might just tug your heartstrings .

some good movie that be categorize " comedy " actually blur comedy and drama . " Graduate " and " Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid " , which be make also late @card@ 's be perfect example . be comedy dramatic undertone , or dramas lot humor ? many respect , " Odd Couple " fall same category be comedy yet highly dramatic deep underpinning human nature . much what happen may be funny audience but character be notlaughing.Despite rather light-hearted TV show 1970 be , original " Odd Couple " be notmerely neat guy and messy guy who be force live together their marital situation . be really about two opposite who must face why their marriage fall apart and how their detrimental idiosyncrasy reveal outside their marriage . neatness , characteristic Felix Ungar ( Jack Lemon perfectly cast ) and messiness , characteristic Oscar Madison ( Walter Matthau ) , be only beginning and somewhat superficial . story unfold , find there be lot more man simply neatness messiness.Briefly , story be really Felix Ungar , who have face impending divorce his wife Francis , who never meet but be important character story . verge suicide , Ungar go only place know : apartment Oscar Madison where group poker buddy hang out so often . learn Ungar be notonly member " poker club " but group know what be happen and try , their inept way , help out . Madison figure good way help Ungar be let move his suicidal tendency wear off.Unfortunately Madison , do n't know what be get . Madison be carefree happy-go-lucky rather irresponsible slob who be refrigerator be last clean probably when Herbert Hoover be still White House . Madison 's idea serve snack be grab moldy cheese and stick two piece bread , and then throw content bag chip table . other hand , enjoy booze and woman , short have good time.Ungar be notonly altogether different , be diametrically opposite . be notonly obsessive neatness nut that find more joy disinfect apartment meeting woman but know more most woman do cooking and fine eating . one point , call his ex-wife , nottalk reconcile , but get her recipe meatloaf . moment , Ungar be go spend rest evening cut cabbage coleslaw . when Madison seem unimpressed , Ungar finally confess be only do his roommate ca n't stand coleslaw . who be guy ? but have endear trait : Felix be also hypochondriac . obsess his health point where make strange noise public place claim be help his sinus . seem have health condition book . and make up more , Felix would probably have . ultimately , be overly self-absorbed.Running movie be reference marriage . one point when Madison be try convince Ungar move , say , " what do want , wedding ring ? " but little do know be notneat guy who ca n't deal messy guy , but other way around . their friendship become inadvertent hellish relationship . and climax occur when Oscar invite two lonely British sister get-together comedic and tragic result . be one good comedy its type ever write and notbe miss , superlative performance Walter Matthau and Jack Lemon role that be hard imagine well play anyone else . be unfortunate write caliber be sadly lack most comedy be produce today .
one tend get slight lot critic and Kurosawa fan , but think be wonderful . be episodic multi-character study Tokyo 's poor , who live city literally make garbage . look A-Bomb just hit , film have sort serene beauty thanks glorious use Technicolor . title come sound make insane young man who drive imaginary trolley slum . all character be wonderful and all story engross , but perhaps most tragic concern man and his young son who live abandon car . when notsearch food , spend their spare time use their imagination build their dream house . emotionally moving and beautiful film .
Streisand fan only familiar her work Funny GIRL film onwards need see show see what brilliant performer Streisand WAS - BEFORE achieve her goal become Movie Star . there have never be female singer quite ever before , and there never would be again ( sorry , Celine - only your dream ! ) , but never again would Streisand sing vibrancy , energy , and , , enthusiasm and vulnerability which perform here - time get Central Park concert only 2 or 3 year later , have be film Funny GIRL Hollywood and her perform style have become less spontaneous and more reserved , more rehearse ( and , let be face : more angry ) - there be wall and audience . live performing be never what really enjoy - do know be her ticket Hollywood , and once no long have do have do little as possible ( and oh , legendary stage fright provide such good excuse ! ).Her vocal here and her early Judy Garland Show appearance be incredible : Streisand could truly make old song sound new again , and composer such Richard Rodgers and Harold Arlen love . but 1970s Streisand be try be " rock " singer , her album pander young audience , over-wrought shriek song that be unworthy her effort or her voice.In ' 80s come back brilliant " Broadway Album , " but go and about what struggle be get do , how " " tell notdo , etc. oh please - when have anyone tell Streisand what do ? could have be do good stuff that , bring audience up her level instead stoop what think young public want . ( " back Broadway " sequel be n't nearly good , Streisand seem feel necessary improve other composer ' work : be alive time , would Richard Rodgers have even recognize his own " Enchanted Evening " ? Rodgers , notorious take singer task play around his melody , would undoubtedly have be Streisand sing what have write ! also blow Michael Crawford CD their duet " Music Night " - apparently remind just whose CD be . why do insist take song that be duet and sing , and song that be n't duet and sing duet someone else who then go on diminish ? )Supposedly Judy Garland take Streisand aside and advise , " do n't let do what do , " advice Streisand waste time heed - her protestation contrary , surely look have always be her way or highway . just imagine - SHE tell CBS brass how her first TV special would be do - guest , just HER.But nobody can argue result that be so evident here . treat brilliant musical phenomenon BEFORE be legend - will be absolutely amaze difference ! PS - watch again last night ( 12/01 ) nothave see many year - be even BETTER remember ! 1st act begin " be late " and include " Make Believe " and " how do Wine Taste , " and Barbra 's homage childhood , " be Five " - climax Streisand appear full ( and mean Full ) orchestra sing " people " - be n't bore song yet and be somewhat short rendition really soar - compare her later " auto-pilot " version . 2nd act ( Streisand 's " kooky " schtick-patter , which have n't change much year ) be famous series depression song set extravagance Bergdorf-Goodman's.The 3rd act be stunner - call " Streisand , Orchestra , and Audience " ( never see audience that supposedly witness historic event ) . her fear audience and dislike such performing , may have be tough part , but so , her credit do n't show . tear " Lover come back " and torchy " when Sun Comes Out " ( ca n't remember which order ! ) , poignant " why do Choose ? ( one my all-time favorite Streisand performance ) and offer medley Funny GIRL song , include ( course ) " do n't Rain My Parade " and my favorite song score , " music Makes Me Dance " . explain " Fanny Brice sing song 1922 , and make toast Broadway " , Streisand then sing " My Man " , and be almost dress-rehearsal template her late screen rendition Funny GIRL film ( main difference be black gown here be sleeveless - her film gown have long sleeve and black background all see be her hand and face ) , but vocal here be more urgent and charge her late film vocal . ( her performance song have everything do Streisand and nothing do Fanny Brice who , course , never sing song such all-out manner Streisand do here or film - see Great ZIEGFIELD glimpse Brice 's more understate version . ) show end Streisand sing " happy day be here again " credits.When be say friend be watch , " have NEVER , EVER , do anything well ! " and be TWENTY-THREE YEARS Old !

Hilda come back last episode ( and Zelda be there other form , but Beth be notepisode ) but do notshow Zelda 's husband or what happen , do have child ? maybe do n't want too much go one episode . also like Hart 's sister who play her spoiled cousin ! be pretty and great actress and be interesting see grow up ! cannon believe have be six year show go off air ! still love rerun ! also , do n't know anybody notice , but early episode , town be call Westbridbe ( make up town believe , which be suppose be close Salem ) but late episode , do n't mention name town be caled Westbridge and think call Boston , that be just where work . also , want add , find episode , " Wild Wild Sabrina " where be teach importance rule , be insulting . be 18 and too old be ground ; would have be insult my parent ground 18 . and think 18 year old might mess up how do , need learn consequence their own . think 18 know rule be important .
 Yes , that be right , be . firmly believe N64 and weird look controller be both design just game could be make . be amaze first time see , its huge environment and colorful character , and its amazing now . play control be perfect , graphics be beautiful , and have Nintendo charm that be always so intangible but undeniably there . must have N64 owner , and reason get N64 everyone else .
final entry George Lucas 's Star Wars movie be often regard weak lot . however , be notsay be totally worthless entry series . contrary . sure , be notas groundbreaking its predecessor and bit more slow-going time , but RETURN Jedi still offer lot warrant price admission.The first third movie , where Luke and his friend rescue Han palace Jabba Hutt , be classic . Jabba , truly disgusting blob bloated flesh who speak his own language , notonly make great villain , but memorable one , too . must have be nightmare construct giant puppet , much less give spark and life see finished product . actually , what also make sequence fun be clever use puppet various member Jabba 's court , include intimidating , slaver Rancor and scary Sarlaac pit monster . build masterfully its climax and pull punch all while.Things get little bit slow second act , where Luke discover and Leia be relate blood and when travel forest planet Endor , home cuddlesome yet stalwart Ewoks . most complaint RETURN Jedi have read seem be center furry creature , that somehow disrupt tone saga . do n't totally agree , moment be probably play bit longer should . however , their leader , Wicket ( play Warrick Davis ) be delightfully memorable creation , and watch how handle Imperial Troops ' technology their simple , natural weapon provide nice contrast.By time get third act , though , pace pick up again , intercut Ewoks battle troop , Lando and Rebel Forces launch attack empire 's all-new half-completed Death Star , and Luke 's final showdown Darth Vader and Emperor . latter tie Jabba Palace sequence highlight movie . Mark Hamill flex his act chop once again Luke Skywalker scene , and watch fully mature Jedi Knight make unforgettable performance . also , as iconic James Earl Jones ' voice Darth Vader be , be rival only shrivel , crone-like Emperor , play deliciously raspy , frightening evil Ian Mcdiarmid . tension trio heighten excitement climactic moment , which be appropriately darkly light and menacingly underscored.The Star Wars movie have always set standard special effect , and technical work RETURN Jedi can easily hold candle its predecessor . space battle fight be as exhilarate as always , and speeder bike chase forest be knockout . course , give movie be make NEW Hope and Empire STRIKES Back , probably should n't be so surprising special effect have reach even great level excellence . acting be classic Star Wars fare ; Hamill , Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher all mature and deepen their role , and Anthony Daniels provide more hilarious moment C-3PO . Frank Oz 's Yoda only appear two scene , but make most . and yes , there be also John Williams ' music.All tell , RETURN Jedi falter little bit middle , first and third act deliver style , make rather satisfactory finale one great saga ever.In 1997 , George Lucas re-release classic Star Wars digitally restore ( and revamp ) " special edition " , which feature added-in effect and/or shot as well enhancement . three , RETURN Jedi appear have cause most commotion Star Wars fan . perhaps can be due jarringly out-of-place ( funny be noteasily offend ) " Jedi Rocks " musical number Jabba 's Palace , which , technically amazing , do disrupt flow film . however , DID end montage scene where see victory celebration occur various planet galaxy . DVD version feature yet more tweaking--we get see more montage finale scene ( notably Naboo , where hear what sound Jar Jar Binks scream , " Wesa free ! " ) , and , what be probably most controversial change , Hayden Christensen specter Anakin Skywalker closing scene . probably due intense ( and unfair ) disdain fan have his somewhat shaky work EPISODE II : attack clone seem inevitable fan would put edition down alone . however , be watch Star Wars saga chronologically ( and contemplate ) , chance be may react little differently . nonetheless , be issue fan have raise , so be probably well be warn beforehand.As nice would be have Lucas release original version three classic film , nonetheless stand what say revamp be " definitive " edition his classic trilogy , and , when view Star Wars movie altogether one complete saga ( Lucas intend ) , actually make sense keep technically and aurally consistent . original film will always be engrave our memory , but new incarnation be just as much fun , can give chance .
see movie million year ( 5 year be exact ) ago first time . light recent event Australian woman Schapelle Corby be imprison Indonesia so call smuggling pot , decide watch movie again . except cry my heart out , ' cause be sucker hot girl need ( just read my review ' stalk Laurie Show ' ) . moist escape my eye , but be hardly bucket fill tear . why ? nottwo heroine be n't utterly adore and helpless , notmovie be n't heartbreaking sight two kid prime their live lock up almost inhuman condition . why then ? why do notcry ? want cry ! when rend movie , except be move , sob there be tomorrow , feel miserable and like . movie be simply too short do . be just script be reduce main plot element , and do psychological aspect be throw aside . Clare Danes and Kate Beckinsale do excellent job portray emotion two friend , but movie just scream more footage girl their depress ( and oppress ) surroundings . mental journey be miss here reason . only get see key moment ( which be very touch , admit ) , probably bad edit . sometimes feel girl be walk around postcard . relationship family member could also have use bit more attention . what be up relationship girl and parent ( especially Alice and her dad ) ? catch glimpse , but film do n't quite offer whole picture , sadly enough.Nonetheless be great movie , and end even have bite my lip bit . but guess have more do acting skill ( and look ) actress ( and music ) then merit director . be honest , hardly know who Kate Beckinsale be watch movie ( again ) . now , be fan ! great movie , as long do n't expect be classic cinema .
first two Jim Thompson adaptation release 1990 ( other be more well-known GRIFTERS ) , AFTER Dark have Thompson 's hallmark : dangerous woman , confidence game , and character that be either notas dim other suspect be , or notharmless.Jason Patric be superb former boxer disqualify sport life due incident ring ( director James Foley use RAGING BULL-esquire sequence flesh out back story ) and too-little-seen Rachel Ward also deliver great performance . but Bruce Dern be film 's secret weapon : his sweet-talk grifter Uncle Bud subtly command his scenes.there be almost comic relief film , so watch prepared be suck void .
think James Cameron might be become my favorite director be my second review his movie . anyway , everyone remember RMS Titanic . be big , fast , and " unsinkable " ... April 1912 . be news and one big tragedy ever . well James Cameron decide make movie out but star two fictional character be spotlight instead ship . well , main review but let remind be opinion and zero fact and only fact that will be present be event film.So our two main character be Jack ( Leonardo Dicaprio ) and Rose ( Kate Winslet ) . be notannoy too much but watch and will find out why could become annoy ( http://tinyurl.com/ojhoyn ) . main villain guess be bad luck , fate , hand God ( blasphemy intend ) , or just plain Caledon Hockley ( Billy Zane ) . combine above and what do get ? ! oh yes ! get love story sink boat . support character be following : my personal favorite , Mr. Andrew ( Victor Garber)(idk be so nice ) , Lovejoy(David Warner ) , Murdoch(Ewan Stewart ) , Lightoller ( Jonathan Phillips ) , Captain Smith(Bernard Hill ) , Molly Brown(Kathy Bates ) , and many more . also get present day treasure hunter , Brock Lovett ( Bill Paxton ) . add something story , something good . action here be awesome , especially second half , drama also good . end can have your eye drop rainstorm or silent tear . story be simple and work . treasure hunter seek Heart Ocean and instead find drawing woman wear say diamond . call and tell her tale RMS Titanic . Two lover separate social class and ultimately , fate ship . everything story work and there be very few flaw . give Titanic , 86 % awesome
be treat viewing Cracker Bag last night preview screening Disney 's Holes . do n't know who decide show but be so very glad do . cracker bag be absolute gem , snapshot Australia early 80s see child 's eye .

Okay , recent history Star Trek have notbe good . Next Generation fade its last few season , DS9 boldly stay where one have stay before , and Voyager start very bad and never really live up its promise . so , when announce new Star Trek series , do nothave high expectation . and , first episode , Broken Bow , do have problem . but , overall be solid Trek material and good romp.I will get nit out way first . opening theme be dull and do n't look forward sit regularly , but be what remotes be . what be really bad be completely gratuitous lotion rub scene just about drive my wife out room . need cut nonsense out.But , plot be strong and move along well . character , though still new , seem be well round and notalways what would expect . Vulcans be clearly be present very differently before , slightly ominous theme . particularly like linguist , who be first Star Trek character notbe able stand proud face death , but rather have deal her phobia and fear . seem stay true Trek lore , something that have be significant problem past series , have plenty time bring thing shoot shield , instant invention technology that can fix anything , and inevitable plethora time-travel story . anyone want start pool how long Borg show up ? , series have enormous potential . be see universe fresh eye . have chance learn how thing get way be late series . how do Klingons go just insulting war ? how do meet Romulans ? how do Federation form and just who put earth charge . why be prime directive so important ? address thing rather spit out time travel episode , will be interesting series.My favorite line : Zephram Cochran say " where man have go before " ( not" one " )
first see movie local station Sunday afternoon horror show back 1969 or 1970 . uncut . be just little kid time , but love and be n't really scared . think have such cool and highly original storyline . think back , be still surprise be show day T.V. uncut year . have seek out film ever since , see over and over again , and always love . would think John Waters would have idolize film . be get be notonly scary film , but one sleazy , trashy film ever make time . and surprisingly , do n't hear one as have cult follow movie such " Blood Feast " or " Hills Have eye " have acquire year . have cult following , but should have really become cult classic , my opinion . as far know , come out little Blood Feast come out , make probably one first true " gore " film . fact , movie have element Hershell Gordon Lewis and little Russ Meyer throw good measure.Anyway , recommend anyone who like trashy , sleazy , black and white horror film early ' 60 's ( think date end read 1960 ) .
film seem be well remember time Tom & Jerry sign peace treaty . thing be idyllic time but , predictably , go sour . probably most memorable moment be endless fight involve pipe , fry pan , and baseball bat two plus Butch dog engage beginning and end short . enjoy bunch and should try catch Cartoon Network .
do n't think have really ever give Walter Matthau his due comedic performer . have certainly be wonderful plenty lighthearted role , but guess always put his success down his character ' grumpiness and ruthlessness , gruff contrast flamboyant personality his frequent co-star Jack Lemmon , and , suppose , natural extension his early work dramatic picture . watch Gene Saks ' ' Odd Couple ( 1968 ) , ' adapt popular Neil Simon play , realisation suddenly click : Matthau be , his own right , absolutely hilarious ! initially strike audience filthy , crude and generally unappealing , his Oscar Madison eventually manage worm his way our heart , culminate hilariously overplay confession emotion Matthau rasp out voice notentirely his own . same time , hold his own comedian , his interplay Lemmon be , course , pitch-perfect ; indeed , film rightly belong actor , who have never fail light up cinema screen , let alone together.Calling mind Billy Wilder 's screenplay ' apartment ( 1960 ) , ' Neil Simon comedy build around rather morbid premise . compulsive house-cleaner Felix Unger ( Lemmon ) , have just be evict his wife twelve year , attempt commit suicide , but fruitlessly abandon idea wreck his back try open hotel window . dejected , arrive house good friend Oscar ( Matthau ) , divorce slob who live alone diet potato crisp and green sandwich ( that might contain either very new cheese or very old meat ! ) . Oscar kindly offer Felix place stay , but be soon overwhelm his friend 's finicky personality and constant insistence absolute cleanliness . pair form unusual sort marital arrangement , Felix assume role effeminate and constantly-nagging wife , and Oscar sloppy , unappreciative husband who always come home later be suppose . be marriage that barely last three week , and , end , can completely sympathise Felix 's ex-wife , who remain unseen.'The Odd Couple ' be terrific comedy , most have lot heart . all their argue , be obvious two roommate have plenty affection other , most movingly see when Felix try launch furious tirade , instead perhaps inadvertently end up inform Oscar how " top " his . pair 's four poker buddy ( John Fiedler , Herb Edelman , David Sheiner and Larry Haines ) be also constantly badger other obscure annoyance , but ca n't deny have get good intention . their decision treat Felix nothing have happen may have sound fine theory , but maybe be ignore be n't quite correct solution Felix 's gloomy feeling inadequacy and inconsequentiality . comedy base popular stage play { be recently disappoint Wilder 's ' Seven Year Itch ( 1955 ) } , film do n't simply strike same chord , and relationship two lead be progressively develop , tear , laughter and much disagreement .
enjoy lot watch movie . have great direction , already know Bigas Luna , bear Spain . and be precisely Spain movie take place , Catalua , be more precise.Luna explore once more theme obcession , case obcession young boy woman 's milk . there be psychological concept story such rejection complex elder son feel birth his brother . movie be what lead obcession young boy who suddenly see all his mother 's milk go recently bear son . so start try find breast who be able feed . find woman recently arrive and here movie be all this.This movie live lot imagery , more story , espectator capture certain moment ( unforgettable moment ) and certain symbol ( movie deserve thourough analysis almost everything that happen usually mean something ... ) . surroundings , landscape , typical region as well surreal behavior character , also symbolic , and excelent ambiguous soundtrack Nicola Piovani transport dimension , notparallel real world , but which intersect time time ... worth living world , worth watch movie , even may eventually and moment get tired and bit sick excessive obcession , which be perhaps take limit ... also enjoy performance protagonist ... positive

number poster have comment unsatisfactory conclusion . be always problem long , complex dramas . crime be essentially banal , so pay off be always anti-climactic , detailed exposition detract human drama . writer have use number clever device try and get , but have notbe entirely successful . answer precisely what happen and why may have be supply , but so be well bury . viewer inevitably feel little cheated.But sense be unimportant . drama be never crime , or even investigation , be about impact event life involved ; family , investigator , witness , press . and as such be gripping . writing be significant cut run mill prime-time drama , and performance uniformly good . ensemble piece be invidious focus individual , but Penelope Wilton deserve special mention extraordinary tour de force mother-wife-daughter , and Janet Mcteer be crack form hard-bitten old cop.One most interesting aspect drama be handling race , elephant room no-one be prepare mention . subtle , powerful stuff .

" Dressed Kill " be Brian DePalma 's good film , absolute thrill ride suspense , humor and style that remain unrivaled today . DePalma have bum rap Hollywood , most people claim rip Alfred Hitchcock . do not. Hitchcock could only dream what DePalma show his thrillers.Sadly , original uncut version " Dressed Kill " be no longer available video . current copy release Goodtimes be Jack Valenti approve R rate cut . but copy DePalma 's original cut still exist . be one distribute Warner Home Video , both green cardboard box Angie Dickinson cover , or black clamshell case theatrical poster silver lining . be one get , can find copy . have green one and be my treasure possessions.Anyway , back story . Dickinson play Kate Miller , sexually frustrated wife who be be treat Dr. Robert Elliott ( Michael Caine ) her obsessive fantasy . trip museum ( real tour-de-force DePalma term camera work and suspense),Miller be pick up stranger . can pretty much guess what happen , ad and box art give away story . but there be few complication . hooker ( Nancy Allen ) be sole witness murder . Kate Miller 's son Peter ( Keith Gordon ) be teenage genius determine solve crime . and Dr. Elliott 's answering machine have certain message ... missing razor ... be notspoil film what have describe above take place opening half hour and DePalma 's big surprise be reserve last hour . film be explicit , however , enough Valenti ( head MPAA ) demand cut film . what surprise be what cut want . several cut opening shower scene and one or two slashing scene and Nancy Allen 's dialogue ( Valenti want " cock " change " bulge " ) . be film that be very violent and bloody , yet objection be sexual content . will love hear Valenti 's explaination how see two woman tender love scene " Lost and Delirious " be somehow more damaging young mind Arnold Schwarzenegger blow away people chain gun . just be n't fair.What make " Dressed Kill " so good be notonly be technical credit first rate , but performance be very good well . Michael Caine , who be lot crap time period , give one his good performance doctor . Angie Dickinson be good usual , possibly actually have strong role here . Nancy Allen add her range performance that have peg one most underrate and overlook actress world . Keith Gordon be wonderful genius and i love all invention his.DePalma be one our good director who have never receive recognition deserve . recent joke AFI 100 Best Thrillers list show very few people actually know what thriller be . be actually open their eye once , would see DePalma have stake his career thriller and be actually good craftsman . be even well " Psycho " . be shame very few actually know that.**** out 4 star

My brother bring movie home rental store and remember expect be such bore . think title especially put off . ca n't ever remember start movie such low expectation and be so completely win over . watch movie twice let my brother take back store . be very infrequent movie speak way one do . be completely catch up Ruby 's situation try make her way her life . bad thing movie be seem end so quickly . could have keep watch hour . downside be have be unsatisfied everything Ashley Judd have do since . be so perfect movie . film be easily my top ten favorite time .
third and last film trilogy be finally crystal clear . be political film more plain entertainment . Jason Bourne will finally know who be and will discover and remember torture be submit order kill his old identity : really kill one who become his corpse . but film be finally reveal all have be organize and plan CIA Blackfriars program that be also clearly reveal film aim eliminate American citizen who try prevent control whole society established and limited group people . who be one essential officer CIA up 1980 , when become vice president ? go along what be be say Internet . then truth will come thanks Jason Bourne but main person who will be able bring truth public and only authority that can take decision concern CIA be woman and woman get Senate involve general investigation . woman and Senate ; read my lip . USA politics be fight medium and two medium be essential presidential campaign : be music and cinema . right now Hollywood and intelligentsia , academia and intellectual be use cinema general , and film particular , build up idea public salvation will come woman and Senate . so go and watch film . be pretty entertaining and have sweet fragrance end period and great change be expect and other be wait , but one be able pretend wo n't come : only point be know how deep and serious will be.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU , University Paris Dauphine , University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin Yvelines
often tag comedy , man White Suit be lay out far more chuckle here and there.Sidney Stratton be eccentric inventor who be n't get chance flourish his invention world nobody pay notice , merely be odd ball odd job man place be . bluff his way Birnley 's textile mill , use their laboratory achieve his goal invent fabric notonly never wear out , but also never need be clean ! . be first proclaim genius and who ignore first suddenly want big piece , but then doom portent industry go bust rear its head and acclaim quickly turn something far more scary.Yes film be very funny , fact scene be dam hilarious , but be satirical edge film that lift way ordinary . contradiction advent technology be crucial theme here , do want invention that save fortune close down industry ? , only have see what happen coal industry Britain know what be on about . decade film be make be crucial point note , making nuclear weapon become more just hearsay , science be advance frighteningly new proportion . watch film and see quick turnaround event main protagonist Stanley , hero enemy one foul swoop , victim his own pursuit good mankind ! , be so dark film should be call man Black Suit.I honestly ca n't find anything wrong film , script Roger MacDougall , John Dighton , and director Alex Mackendrick could be film today and would n't be out place such be sharpness and think mind have . sound and setting be tremendous , direction be seamless , tonal shift adroitly handle Mackendrick . scene be just wonderful , one particular tug heart string and bring think certain scene David Lynch 's Elephant Man 29 year later , and yet such downturn event film still manage take wink genius that be Alec Guinness get close out film keep viewer ponder notonly future Stanley , but also rest rapidly advance world.A timeless masterpiece , thematically and piece art , positive .
have see film more once now , and there be always someone complain " obvious construction " plot afterwards . but then - be part Petzold 's game : play along rule genre.It be very nice , how highly improbable story how two girl ( Timoteo/Hummer ) meet , be again mirror , even more improbable story , girl make up casting . film be journey fact and fiction , be more potential , thing that might have happen past or might be happen future , be about actual ongoings . be reverie , sort - so apt enough there be lot motive , Freud might have find interesting his dream analysis , all " doppelganger"-constellations.Also , think , " Gespenster " might be interesting be watch comparison current Asian cinema uncanny : Petzold 's everyday urban architecture also feel haunt unobtrusive , strangely familiar way . film be notobvious . describe story two girl who meet and eventually become friend and lover , or story orphan mother , who search Europe her lost daughter , clearly do n't say much nature " Gespenster " .
This be wonderfully write and well act psychological drama . be notreally horror flick look something Ring or Grudge will be disappoint . what really surprise film be intelligence and subtle attention detail plot and effort make be internally consistent . also appreciate absence Dr. Phil psychobabble or New Age revisionism . rather advance agenda , filmmaker just tell story , tell well and let viewer think . sparse dreamscapes be reminiscent Wyeth painting and amazingly effective.A great example how make good film small budget , big studio , star actor , big-name director ( be far good many Hitchcock 's film ) , special effect or " clever " plot twist .
( spoiler ) have notread James M. Cain novel ( ` Postman Always Rings twice ' ) which movie be base , so can compare film version , but have see and love 1946 US version ( also entitle ` Postman').Even good be gem Italy , which , have read , be ` mutilate ' edit too many blatant reference Fascist regime . well , matter what be leave be fine piece cinema , apparently forerunner neo-realist movement film-making . can certainly see why whatever harsh edit do go , pervade sense societal and cultural , as well personal oppression remain , hang heavy protagonist , who therefore face many limit life.Consider Gino , young drifter , notwell educate , unemployed , and resort stow away , steal and con people order get , his one pair shoe so threadbare as be virtually useless.In Giovanna , see way out , yet should have keep go , Giovanna be oppress her loveless marriage old man money , her job ( work trattoria her husband , slave away bar and kitchen ) , and her sex . past , have limit option , and decide marry restaurant/gas station owner ( Giuseppe Bregana , play Juan de Landa ) anyway , know would notmake her happy . tell Gino feel sick time Bregana touch her.On pretext help Bregana fix his car and send village buy needed part ( which have fact pocket ) , Gino win Bregana 's favor ( promise also fix break water pump water symbolize life , or lack thereof ) and be leave alone Giovanna . immediately start heated , passionate , yet volatile love affair.Gino soon feel stifle relationship , and feel need move on again when Giovanna propose dispose her husband . want part , Gino leave town train ride can afford , kindly pay gypsy-type man name Spagnolo , fellow train passenger . Gino , Spagnolo represent sort freedom , and become friend ( Spagnolo also symbolize Gino 's morality and conscience ) , travel and find work carnival together . finally Gino have steady employment . his dismay ( be notyet his love Giovanna ) , month have pass when Bregana and his wife go carnival and Bregana persuade Gino go ` back home ' live and work again , be handy have around.Too weak-willed resist , know will reunite and Giovanna , Gino agree and go back stay couple . give Gina 's demand get rid her husband . evil deed be do , Giovanna become more cold-blooded ever , seem have very little conscience , guilt and shame eat away Gino hurt man who never do harm . as much want leave do again briefly , be now inextricably link , and must face consequences.I like way Spagnolo character come back Gino 's life act judge his misdeed that be very good , and interesting , add dimension story.While the ' 46 U.S. version Lana Turner and John Garfield get bit lose quagmire peripheral character , especially cop and lawyer , Ossessione do well concentrate much more psychological effect crime lover alone . give final outcome even more potency , and make powerful statement reinforce helplessness inherent society which character must live.A minor quibble : amount time ( hardly ) that elapse undying love be pronounce lover , how quickly kill husband ( there be botched first attempt U.S. version ) ; Gino 's very quick-to-escalate relationship dancer/hooker quickly profess their love well , and be willing risk great deal man just meet ! rather unrealistic , be n't ? find time-frame problem quite distract make think must have miss something somewhere . otherwise , well worth viewer 's time . acting and direction be uniformly good . recommend .
The Best Times be one great sleeper time . setup do nottax your patience , development be steady , many intertwine relationship be lovingly establish , gag and bit work and be funny . there be lot sentimentality . Kurt Russell play Reno Hightower put one his good performance , and Robin Williams play Jack Dundee be sure-footed as ever . cast also include many great supporter . Jack 's wife be play Jack Palance 's daughter , who be lovely , as be Reno 's wife , who be great comedian . ca n't tell how many time have watch movie , how many time have enjoy and how often wish more people could see .

year 2006 , " Cold Blood"-a riveting thriller 1967-has two new interesting context do notprevious have . first , and most chillingly , be fact be star , Robert Blake , be recently trial murder his wife . second , recent Oscar win biopic , " Capote " show muddle back story haunting true crime tale 's author , Truman Capote . two new twist make film timely modern audience.As stand alone film 's era , " Cold Blood " be top notch way . most notable be stunning black and white cinematography Conrad Hall ( later " American beauty " and " Road Perdition " fame ) . many still film Kansas farm house night or tree-lined back country road could be sell fine art photography . combine cracker-jack direction Brooks and superb edit early scene ( where see mundane daily life innocent family about be senselessly slaughter beautifully intertwine plot two hapless killer ) , rich brood atmosphere be create set stage riveting suspense ( even when everyone know how be all go end due fact its all base real life event ) . be also great see day and age how brilliantly stage harrow murder scene can be depict where graphic nature act be transmit viewer subliminally nary drop blood show screen.The film be also anchor nicely Robert Blake 's eerie performance more sympathetic yet senselessly brutal side kill duo . flashback scene his horrible childhood be extremely well do . then there be scene end film where be speak reverend be send gallows and make his last " confession " so speak . be one classic movie moment that be perfect marriage gritty acting , superb writing , flawless direction , and haunt photography . dare erase your mind stark image rain 's reflection window flow down Robert Blake 's pallid face lieu actual tears.The only thing hamper " Cold Blood " be slow move middle act where killer be lam and force nature social commentary end . tacked-on political message death penalty be secondary its compelling depiction mad killer and their prey .
have recently see production DVD . be first time have see be originally broadcast 1983 and be just as good remember . first as be worry would seem old fashion and suppose be little date and very wordy BBC serial be back then . ( miss wonderful costume dramas that seem be always Sunday afternoon back then ) but aside be as near perfect could have be . be bit " Jane Eyre " purist be my favourite book and have never see production that be faithful book one . have recently re-read book well and dialogue be just spot . read scene end where Rochester question Jane what St John be notice their word be exactly reproduce screen Dalton and Clarke and do perfectly.All other production that have be do seem lack way , some even leave out " Rivers " family and their connection Jane altogether . also think be only production include " Gypsy " scene do correctly.The casting be perfect , Zelah Clarke be Jane be describe book " small plain and dark " and disagree look too old . Timothy Dalton may be little too handsome but be absolutely perfect Rochester , portray aspect his character just right and act his sock off ! agree other comment even appear quite scary time , scene when turn around slowly church when wedding be interrupt , his expression be fantastically frightening . but then favourite scene his joy be wonderful see when Jane run down stair and his arm morning declare their love one . love that be wonderfully portray and totally believable . oh be love man ! there be couple scene that be strangely miss however , when Jane climb bed die Helen and also when Rochester take Jane shopping her wedding thing ( think be but maybe my memory be play tricks).Finally never see production Jane Eyre - simply most see one be simply perfection !
The Sarah Silverman program be ... well other show . laugh track , painful joke , just program .

" First Casualty War be innocence . "
wo n't go too much detail plot movie other reviewer have cover pretty much same ground.Just want say really enjoy film very much . Peter Falk 's performance alone be reason enough watch film.A small scale ' road trip ' movie Falk & Paul Reiser upstate NY fall be set most action film.Very well write adult target audience mind . plenty reality base humor & well play drama give film feeling could be your own family.Really ca n't say enough film that be damn shame lovely movie do n't get more exposure other trashy junk there does.It be great see Falk big lead man role again & make most . prove his famous friend & writer/director John Casavettes be right cast Falk many his ground break film 60s & 70s .
think opening 20 minute film be perhaps one most exciting film , brilliant music score work build tension shatter climax . what cinema goer make 30s , can only imagine . ' Times ' say time , ' miracle have come screen . ' watch and marvel .
Charleton Heston wear one , James Franciscus wear one but Mark Wahlberg opt notdon traditional loin cloth . hope one cast Tarzan .

read nothing but good thing movie and finally have chance watch late last night and be everything expect be and more.This be way proper horror movie should be.I think reason be so scary be be so realistic . spooky sounding score be perfect set dark mood.I like dramatic opening scene and enjoy how rest movie play out.It be very easy follow and understand movie which be way too complicated.The special effect be very good.I would love see more horror movie one.This be easily one my favorite's.A realistic thunder and lightning storm would have set nice atmosphere movie.Other then have all element good horror movie needs.I highly recommend movie anyone who can appreciate good scary movie that pull punches.I will be add my collection.The DVD have interesting special feature .
there be nothing remotely scary modern " horror " which be insult word " horror " . Freddie V Jason , Scream movie , Cabin Trash , and especially Stephen King 's infantile attempt - have recycle story Monkey 's paw whatever , often same story - horror writing and film ( Kubrick 's version Shining which actually be scary , King 's book which be as frightening my big toe - left one , which still have nail.But Woman Black be rare modern film that will make hair back your neck stand end . be way should be do ; director create tension , and scary ghost ever actually see simply have suddenly turn up stand still somewhere or other incredible look her face . then bring ghastly disturbing close . have learn his lesson master who know how make horror - Val Lewton ( original Cat people ) and Robert Wise ( Val Lewton disciple and director Haunting and Body Snatcher ) , Jacques Tournier ( Val Lewton disciple who direct truly horrify zombie film , notgross rubbish Raimi do ( gross be n't scary , folk , be just gross ) , and Lewis Allen ( The Uninvited ) , and course Jack Clayton 's turn Henry James innocent , and way master suspense , Hitchcock , can still bring edge your seat even slow-building and burning period piece Capricorn.TEN Stars ...
' Aakrosh ' , be second film Govind Nihalani director.Till movie be make there be audience documentary India.This movie prove point documentary can fulfil requirement commercial film dilute its essence . be one successful movie year which be release . movie contest big banner bollywood like'COOLIE ' , ' BETAAB','HERO ' 1983.SmithaPatel , movie act more conscience hero whenever drift away or lose his composure be there remind . be notusual heroine do usual stuff run around tree and shrubs.At one time,she even give up her love when hero 's ruthlessness touch roof top.There be character movie , which be play Om Puri contemporary , Naseeruddin Shah.He play inspector-turned-alcoholic character.The role convey message end result honest cop who rub wrong side system which also give viewer chance forecast hero 's ending.In his debut film,Sadashiv Amrapurkar captivate audience his cameo role which ultimately win well supporting actor filmfare.The cop movie be notcomplete straight forward personality be able adjust system extent . anger which leave handedly continue Govind Nihalani 's other film " Drohkaal " . even two decade , movie be remember just director and entire crew . one play their part par excellence .
" Dressed Kill " have be more or less forget critical circle past 20 year , but be true American classic , film which be much more just glossy thriller.I sincerely hope DVD release will give more people chance hear and see .

have often wonder just how much Casper be mean child ... all issue revolve his identity ( film be lead believe be spirit dead child , his home be cemetery plot ) , as well disturbing message bring particular film . maybe Casper be mean more morality play , or Famous Studios feel break new ground ' reality ' cartoons.THERE be Good Boos Tonight be well-animated project-no doubt there . but , plot development involve fox ( who become Casper 's friend , but meet tragic end ) be concern.Give Famous Studios credit--they tackle death respect ... but , stark image Casper 's mourning be rather graphic and disturbing child ( denouement do offer happy ending , but wo n't give away ending ) , and violence be rather steep , even 1940 's standards.This might be good cartoon parent use help explain death children--but would n't pop VCR perky cartoon break .
when think movie , all adjective that come mind somehow relate physical appreciation world . texture , smell , color , that be how think movie should be judge term . see rich golden tone surround young concubine asleep fireplace , or sweltering Turkish bath , and let flood your sense impression spice , coarse cloth , smooth skin , scent oil , flicker flame , satin rustle . do n't just watch and listen , be absorb , let drone voice storyteller mesmerize .
think " Weird Al " Yankovic be hilarious , wo n't be disappoint COMPLEAT al . notonly do rare mockumentary feature many Yankovic 's more memorable video ( " Surgeon " and " Love Rocky Road " ) , but be inter-spliced funny vignette supposedly highlight parodist 's rise fame . Yankovic be nottaste , but his humor be harmless and imaginative enough even non-fans will least be lightly amuse . die-hard fan will love notonly its content , but also its relatively early look Yankovic 's now nearly three decade career . suitable age , kiddy will no doubt love funny visual .

someone who have never condescend Adam Sandler term talent , be do and many comic actor , walk Reign expect great film , notsimply his presence movie but think look very good overall . even someone who already think Sandler could deliver effective dramatic performance be write here be surprise how fantastic be . will make weep , especially his purposefully sudden and unexpected monologue . what be amazing his role be be character be hard say have see before . have see many emotionally scar character , many mentally retarded people , many loner , many passionate self-centered artist , but Sandler 's Charlie Fineman be none . may have taste way , but his character be truly unpredictable and completely individual . be joy audience be draw emotionally and be tug which way someone whose problem , mindset , and provocation be completely different most character him.Don Cheadle deliver interesting performance completely different level . be man . be most normal possible person world , so much so will hardly find many character his either , or least that be play way play Alan Johnson , whose name be even find assembly line . Cheadle be brilliant be funny , jolt , smart , and stupid way many normal people are.The rest cast be populate actor and actress who have hardly do anything awhile small but quite colorful role . Jada Pinkett-Smith be overly refine upper middle class wife , Donald Sutherland be impatient but surprising judge , Robert Klein be Sandler 's desensitize father-in-law.Mike Binder 's script be quite brilliant say something quite profound wonder communication its guise . be much more subtle , say , Babel , and have much more close-to-home ideal.The camera be only interested reality its image as oppose mere style . film strike sort sendback kitchen-sink style 1970s . cinematography be grainy and unfasten , but be its charm . be n't about attract camera and gloss that would have dilute its story such.The music , which play major role film , and its title , be very powerful . beginning , feel be Schmidt or Little Miss Sunshine sort soundtrack , but soon realize be more . fact , film be pack lot music that stimulate lot most emotional scenes.Reign be major statement notonly society but also film . go show even director Blankman be capable wonder .
here be film that do n't really need much recommendation . be classic comedy , very funny and entertaining and which , course , ultimately inspire successful television series which many would say be even good ( enjoy , personally).For some , be hard warm up Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau Felix Unger and Oscar Madison when be be wean TV show star Tony Randall and Jack Klugman ( or perhaps vice versa ) . but what have get there case be four good actor who real life seem so much their film counterpart manage make characterization their own . be Neil Simon 's humorous material that be key , and where laugh really originate from.For who have somehow never hear ODD COUPLE , be story neurotic and fussy neat-freak ( Lemmon ) who be throw out 12-year marriage his long-suffering wife and take up residence Manhattan apartment his sloppy and totally irresponsible buddy ( Matthau ) . pit two unlikely roommate together same four wall make hugely funny predicament .
most recommendable masterpiece , notonly underlie theme story but also unmatchably brilliant and ingenious picture work Angelopoulos , notmention acting giant , Mastroianni and Moreau , and remarkable character play Ilias Logothethis . Gregory Karr 's performance may seem overshadow his " tough " partner ' first stance but fact perfectly play his character , which be reveal his very last scene girl ( Khrysikou ) and man ( Mastroianni ) , hint beforehand . ( hence spoiler.)Get your expectation straight ! be " art movie " whatever meaning phrase have offer and require attention . notspend free time , but watch artwork necessary concentration as read book or attend concert . due overall photographic style , large screen viewing be recommended.Dialogues be use sparingly . but film include -in addition standard Greek and English speaking- fragment speak Albanian , Kurdish and Turkish , which will be attractive who be charm beauty hear various language .
One great thing about many superb Chinese movie can find , be lucky , video store , be be very accurate retellings actual , true story . farewell , my Concubine , Emperor and Assassin and movie be perfect example . film maker take true story and work hard accurately create movie compromise fact dramatic or commercial convenience -- hallmark much Hollywood , and especially Disney films.In story follow late year famous local street performer dub King Masks his mastery Sichuan Change Art . have lose his only son many year earlier , search find male heir carry his rare and die art society that forbid female have such work .

Carrie-Ann Moss , play against-type , be terrific , as"Helen Robinson , " June Cleaver-like wife ; Billy Connolly be great grunt good-hearted zombie " Fido ; " Tim Blake Nelson ( " Mr. Theopolis " ) be hoot be neighbor sexy zombie girlfriend " Tammy , " and Henry Czerny and Dylan Baker dad ( check ) be excellent , too K'Sun Ray young " Timmy Robinson , " should n't be overlook , either . fact , probably have more line movie anyone.If explain story will sound so stupid few would watch . will just have take word people here who like and find be very , very pleasant surprise . need dark sense humor , though ; appreciation absurd .
Enterprise , late high budget spin-off most successful franchise film and or television history open tune 90-minute episode call ' Broken Bow ' . first be sweep massive action sequence Klingon be chase Suliban ( who be main enemy first season show ) . there televised movie take journey that seldom get as good be , good character development , story and action/visual effect ever see such short amount time.The opening-credits be debatable subject minority enterprise fan , whom some believe song be out place . what fail realise be lyric . listen actual song , instead theme , then will begin piece part puzzle together . and eventually series progress further and further , and learn more our valiant captain and his crew , will song actually become meaningful . overall Diane Warren 's theme be beautifully orchestrate and be sing just as well opera singer Russell Watson.What make television show watchable and worth watch time and time again be its character and way become structure and layer . enterprise be ( my opinion ) one most well cast show Next Generation . choose Scott Bakula , Captain Jonathan Archer be good decision Gene cast Patrick Stewart Jean-Luc Picard . captain always lead show , Bakula add subtlety his role and bring huge smile face anyone blood pump their vein . simply be ( actor wise and character wise ) superb human being and his charm , wit , and compassion be overwhelming watch . as other cast member , favourite mine be John Billingsley who play Dr. Phlox . be also nice see non-human play role , and decision give captain dog , name ' Porthos ' be well-receive idea . show character development be brilliant , be fast , well time and almost perfect . say almost sadly Travis Mayweather 's character play Briton Anthony Montgomery be little weak end first season . do have thing say here and there , but remain hand producer make more important . Jolene Blalock be wonderful sometimes harsh but equally loveable Subcommander T'Pol . Dominic Keating Lieutenant Malcolm Reed play strong role and be convince armoury officer . Connor Trinneer play Commander Charles " Trip " Tucker who always add charm and comedic style his character and finally Linda Park Ensign Hoshi Sato , who often play weak character but thankfully quickly become interesting . character make up enterprise , and all bring quality Star Trek have n't see long time . person make show worth watching . smile and feel-good sense be guarantee right first time see all together bridge Starship enterprise NX-01.The ship , NX-01 be somewhat questionable design . series be set 150 year now and 100 year Captain Kirk . so why then do ship appear be similar design mid 24th century ship , namely Akira class Starship ? continuity have be issue Enterprise , but thankfully Rick [ Berman ] and Brannon [ Braga ] offer suitable explanation and everyone . continuity be only problem be forever scrutinise show and be obsess tiny detail . see show and open mind , then will have problem , but there be urge know ' why ' all time . so what do Berman and Braga offer Star Trek fan-base issue deign ship ? accord NX-01 be how be incident First Contact . when Zefram Cochrane see Enterprise-E his telescope and speak away team lead Commander Riker , change idea his head . be good enough explanation me.lets move . course its notas easy fan accept sort answer , go as far as refuse see show get reasonable answer . come guy grow up.When George Lucas destroy Star Wars saga launch his profit make new trilogy , fan could n't do anything , only watch and sap up anyway . and then learn , well maybe its notbad . ca n't accept quality show what be , notwhat should be your mind , then go elsewhere . or try become producer show and then see what can do.The set Enterprise remind very much Defiant Deep Space Nine . often appear cold and have eerie look modern structure and cry out belong military . perhaps why crew USS Enterprise ( aka flagship American fleet ) so much . be strike set , and represent show perfectly.Rick Berman ' overlord empire ' John Logan so accurately put and his counterpart Brannon Braga have hit nail head exactly where should have , and all right place . that be technicality , visual , sound , edit or score . Enterprise be fine demonstration just how good televised science fiction can ultimately be , when hand genius . late Gene Roddenberry would be proud series and Star Trek fan , so should .

do n't know contain spoiler or not, but do n't want risk be blacklist year 3462.I disagree entirely viewer comment that have describe *Guns , Germs and Steel* " politically correct " and " neo-Marxist . " can have watch same series *I* did.The series *I* watch depict history European colonisation America and southern Africa particular inaccuracy . see nothing series that portray European bad people who happen be lucky , though Europeans often *were* lucky - and there be nothing wrong luck . neither do see native people portray poor little innocent thing . anything , Inca be rather arrogant - would expect leader would be when deal foreigner , his country have notbe conquer live memory other world power.I certainly see nothing that could be construe Marxist or Neo-Marxist , most incredibly elastic imaginations.Otherwise , many African people *do* have built-in immunity malaria and other tropical disease that European lack . time be height their success , Aztec , Maya and Inca civilisation *were* as advance other world - and as wealthy ; sometimes more so . Aboriginal American and Khoi-San population *were* decimate smallpox and other disease introduce European ; just European colonist be decimate tropical disease malaria . ( note : Khoi-San people be completely different other sub-Saharan African peoples.)So , do n't see what other commentator be complain about . only thing *I* can find complain about be series do n't tell anything do notknow time finish seventh grade . there be really nothing new way historical information film . do , however , present nice dramatisation event , such conquest Incas ; production value be very high ; and fill few hole here and there that do n't get cover Mrs. Gruber 's Sixth Hour Social Studies Class Milan Middle School.If rent or buy , assume have decent primary and/or secondary school education , wo n't learn anything new , but will have enjoyable and entertaining time review what already learn ( or should have learn ) time hit high school .

big-time Prince fan last three four year , really ca n't believe have only just get round watch " Purple Rain " . brand new 2-disc anniversary special edition lead buy . wow , be really look forward watch , but be n't prepare just how electric actually be . Prince 's musical performance movie be nothing short astound - really have move one . be very familiar ( repeat listen ) classic " Purple Rain " album and all its song , but see context movie completely alter your perception tune and lyric - COMPUTER Blue , BEAUTIFUL ONES , when DOVES CRY and Purple Rain . there be something indescribably hypnotise scene where Prince and Revolution perform . closing song Baby I 'M A Star and I WOULD DIE U show how much energy and sheer talent Prince be brim his mid-20s ( be overflow ! ) , blow away . even make Michael Jackson seem inanimate even his peak years.Prince show how win girl your dream - drive lake , make her jump , then drive off - absolutely hilarious stuff hindsight.Some scene be very 1980s and unintentionally hilarious but add film 's overall charm . Morris Day be cool cat block ( and hilarious ) , and when his group Time perform bird get see Morris Day and Jerome Benton light stage Minneapolis funk style - love their dancing bit , and how Benton provide Morris mirror mid-performance.I already ca n't wait watch again , really ca n't ! extra be terrific - particularly see young Eddie Murphy pre-Beverly Hills Cop admit be " Prince groupie " .
First , explanation : my headline , be give film only 8 star overall be notone good film ever make . all criticism register here have valid point . also , be warn enjoy script really need appreciate Neil Simon 's brilliance find wit real human banter . do have distinctively new York ear dialogue -- especially dry , Jewish , love-suffused sarcasm -- and have trouble accept sarcasm expression love , then might have trouble accept optimism heart movie.So much warning . here be my main point : Walter Matthau be flat-out perfect , even perfect , movie . have never see funny , or more touching matter -- same time show hilariousness character who refuse give up his Big Star self-image or insufferable attitude even his coherence be decline , also show more vulnerable , maybe even heartbreakingly scare person grouch . and only barely show sad part -- be just enough really get happen be cope your own father 's or husband 's mental decline right now ( mention warning ) , but artistically , be just enough pathos give character most authentically deep root be see possibly film performance . be method acting -- Matthau 's performance be exquisite character work and pure delight comic delivery . be masterpiece comic acting.About Richard Benjamin : personally find his acting annoy general , and his work movie be exception -- have fine moment here . ( " chicken be funny ... . " be one . ) so like , should like here , and do n't movie wo n't change your mind.About 1976 Oscar ... agree Matthau be unfortunate be up Nicholson " Cuckoo 's Nest " year . be killer year leading-actor competition ; only there be separate Oscar comedy and drama , then think Best Actor Oscar would have go Al Pacino " Dog Day Afternoon " and Walter Matthau " Sunshine Boys " -- notDis Jack 's fine work McMurphy , but think Pacino and Matthau be CLEARLY more masterful and astoundingly effective and downright legendary their performance Nicholson be year . also , believe Burns get support Actor Oscar more sentimental reason quality his performance -- mean , be good movie , but notgood . ( Burns 's fine-as-ever but unexceptional-in-itself return show biz beat Brad Dourif 's truly brilliant debut " Cuckoo 's Nest , " notmention Chris Sarandon 's stunning debut " Dog Day Afternoon " -- which think prove my theory.)Oscar theory aside , here be my bottom line review : like Matthau 's comic acting , then see movie and savor his powerhouse tirade and wonderful grandmother-inspired gesture , fleeting facial expression and seemingly unscripted aside . ( but be currently deal pain watch old person lose his grip , then be warn movie might either be comic relief need or dose reality too painful watch right now . )
first mystery be guess what Welles ' original film be like . make real adventure -- see incomplete skeleton and use cinematic forensics , imagine beautiful woman once supported.If do , will both see and experience perhaps one good film mystery ever . mystery go , narrative be rather ordinary : simple diversion , one jealous husband red herring.What be rather miraculous be Welles ' placement story artificial eye see dark , dark multifaceted world . first real noir , but even dark . be notobviously twisted world , think camera . what can see firsthand be someone create vocabulary that would later become common.For all celebration , Kane be success great drama and story . camera 's eye be shocking , but experimental . Welles would go there explore mystery narrative and self-reference Shakespeare eye . Othello and Macbeth be both begin period , and consider part single vision this.The noir feel here hinge notion people be notcharge their life , even little -- be manipulate random factor environment . so tell story , Welles have make environment character . several character suspect mystery.Thus have famous lighting , block and angle know ( and have since see countless time ) . and have deliberately close set : park , yacht , picnic area , aquarium , dock , courtroom , Chinese theater and funhouse . be certain what be cut barbarian be lot and lot ' external ' narrative deal notcharacter but strange environments.My own solution mystery be funhouse do , other character-environments introduce suspect . other word , manipulation Black Irish ( who know note and one scene type union hall be aspiring novelist ) be : force human conspiracy ( park or civilized version , courtroom ) nor nature ( picnic or civilized version , aquarium).Instead be matter deliberate caprice god amusement . be course self-reference what Welles be do : put people ( include ) hell our own caprice , matter underscore Peking Opera set Welles dope up . and course lead funhouse where environment directly tinker perception.More self-reference : surely there be conscious comment his relationship his soon be exwife . but believe there be strong subconscious comment his own taunt environment which work , studio environment . surely Welles be as much screw , and much same way , his character . and screw take form murder film , leave rot corpse mention beginning comment.That poor Rita come China tie whole thing , Chinese theater , expect rape above , loss woman . investment environment .
that be interested know how exactly humanity come be encase big red pod that make crave pomegranate , there be duo " Second Renaissance " short . be notexactly sure why be split two part , especially be credit one DVD ( and be short view other format but DVD ? ) , but be informative even have few gaps.What really make first part stand out , second part and rest animation well , be parallel show robot uprising and civil right . graphic homage slavery , fascism , concentration camp , and mass grave be mix verbal reference Million Man March and humanity 's God-complex . fact , " God " be never really reference short , instead replace " Man 's own image".As far short go collection , " Second Renaissance : part " be far most effective bring out emotion . be sorrowful and disturbing view potential humanity become " architect its own destruction . " may be turn off concept short rip directly out previously establish science fiction literature , but then again , that be basically what most Matrix series have do , and have be drive force its success.--PolarisDiB
one great western time ! but one , many other , do notdeal nature , horse , shootout , etc. , but instead deal one rifle , Winchester ' 73 , and how one rifle effect other and how effect . rifle be notliving , breathing , human being , right ? may be incline believe be not. but seem have mind its own , two very similar reason : get back its rightful owner end , even though rest picture , its unthoughtful " owner " do their good make sure do not, and never seem be content get back its original owner , so , coincidentally , unthoughtful " owner " always seem lose somehow or get kill try protect and keep , get back James Stewart , then be " content " . but , notone owner deserve have . Stewart do , course , win . McNally do not, have be dirty thief and steal . Drake definitely do not, would probably lose poker game , and besides , Drake be too cowardly fight , so why should have one-of-a-kind rifle will noteven use ? Duryea do not, be just chuckle maniac , and all know chuckle maniac do notdeserve gun . film have sort noir edge only Western can have , such Ox-Bow incident . Western have their own type noir , much different 30 's and @card@ 's Bogart film . be , hands-down , good one five Stewart-Mann western , even my personal favorite be " Bend River " . other four become much different one . do notthink coincidence see other four be color , and be black and white . be noir edge . five film have revenge and dark past Stewart 's part play film , point where be notjust Stewart 's dark side , but also actually sort character , notone be list credit , but one that can only recognize and know be there , always present . however , one , notjust revenge and dark past , but also term supreme danger , and character that be very different Stewart make surpass other four aspect . but Stewart never cross line . do , however , walk line light and dark . be why black and white play such integral part film . could have all be black and white , or could have all be color . but one be black and white , and other four be color , and there be very good reason .
movie be classic . would have say movie catch good working man who learn his mistake . could all get along and learn way everyone movie do . have important part show how family be important part life , and how pride can cause lose something important life can notfind " Big THROAT " and swallow be pride .
 Charming way , film be perfect be mood feel good . love jazz music , be must see . enjoy see loveable character that make smile , can bring tear your eye and swing there be tomorrow film be . be look intense , deep , heavy piece art be dissect and analyze perhaps best stick something Darren Aronofsky ( other word - reviewer djjohn lighten up , do n't know good time when see ! ) my only complaint be movie be just too darn short . guess will just have watch several more time get my fill .
Guy and Dolls be movie itch remake . be make forty-eight year ago . its two main star be either dead or 409 pound . remake , big star now , would be box-office success , would notbe able capture magic that go version . its boundless energy ca n't be recapture , nor can pure joy get when watch something : huge , widescreen , big entertainment movie.Marlon Brando ( who last clock 409 lbs. last time hear ) play Sky Masterson , one big gambler New York . Frank Sinatra be Nathan Detroit , whose as-often-as-he-can-find-a-speakeasy-for-it crap game be city-wide famous . however , when one place have leave hold be charge $1,000 , Detroit need money fast . bet Masterson $1,000 ca n't take missionary Sarah Brown ( Jean Simmons ) Havana next day.Guys and Dolls be basically nothing more unsavory type singing and dancing , which usually , do here , add up fun . be obvious see how be Broadway musical : there be n't many set , and scene be long . be complain about one thing , be how uneven song be . time , there be two song scene ; other time , thirty minute go one . guy and Dolls be never boring , just great time.My rating : positiveNot rate .

when hear film be direct Ang Lee , make sure see . Taiwanese director burst fame " Wedding Banquet " and " Eat Drink Man Woman " few year ago and then move on " sense and sensibility " and " Ice Storm " . now , turn his attention American icon -- Civil War.This story take place Missouri , Union state Southern sympathy . never officially join Confederate army . instead , form outlaw band , call " bushwhacker " , grow hair long , and sometimes would confiscate Union uniform which wear over their regular clothing.The movie depict their moral dilemma , high drama time , and their supposedly heroic mission kill storekeeper and farmer who aid Union . there be star movie , consider " Jewel " singer , well cast young confederate widow star.Tobey Macquire be cast young German farm boy who be deride his heritage Germans be suppose Union sympathizer . young man be excellent actor , full fresh face youth whose performance encompass his wonder and subtle realization be expose horror war.Jeffrey Wright be free slave who travel bushwhacker his loyalty young man who buy his freedom . give fine and understate performance.Some acting , however , be wooden , especially long conversation have morality . and their costume be too new . and " southern gentleman " theme manner and hat-tipping and politeness woman come bit much -- especially make point murder all man who pull their woman 's arm , then burn down store and houses.While do n't think will go down one Lee Ang 's " great " movie , do find fascinate , spite slow part and its excessive length 140 minute . be interested what be happen next and feel empathy character who all come across real and imperfect human being catch up force history.Not much action usual war movie , but yet still recommend -- especially Civil War buff .
love movie , Jouvet , Arletty , Blier , Carn ... almost everything have already be say movie , but there be one detail will like shed light : footage real , still stand , Htel du Nord ( be still ? hear be be demolish ... ) have be use movie - whole scene have be rebuild set , main reason be could notstop traffic St Martin canal several week .
movie leave intellectual mind think and try analyze story . too can understand why people would trash movie.If be Jerry Bruckheimer fan , movie may notsuitable u.This movie present high degree realism . actor and actress ' performance be examplary . notfake , just natural.No special sound.effects , so special side effects.The camera work be excellent , music be oh so good . ca n't wait get soundtrack.It leave your body numb , Constant Garderner.The directly have raw talent , certainly notfollower .
film young republic few number be Buccaneer (1958)stands out finely craft film . Charleton Heston excel his portrayal Old Hickory 's defence New Orleans throw together force militia , regular and pirate promise reprieve.after Christmas 1814 peninsula veteran lead sir edward packenham , duke wellington 's brother law bear down city new orleans . andy jackson have day draw together scratch force defend city bale hay.Charlton Heston project Jackson 's terrifying presence and awe inspiring power command . yet there be few colorful comic relief . might English lioness about pounce , young blond haired voluteer New Orleans ask : guess ruckus be about start.the battle be about rage but notlong . true form British march straight wither American fire . less few minute attempt reconquer lose north American territory have be foiled.the battle scene movie last slightly longer actual battle itself.there be colorful side story film young volunteer his first dance celebrate victory .
This superb self-contained work that be unconnected anything or . brat Pack croon and club exclusivity be notmy biscuit choice , but law-free world make alluring ambiance . film be pack Our Guys , distinctive actor who add distinction work win performance . dialogue be joy . fact be new vernacular . One few film that can be watch repeatedly deepen appreciation.Highpoints include Billy Idol 's British loutishness , Ben London 's vulturine brassware , Kyle 's squirmishness , and survey ad hoc philosophy .
Sabrina Teenage Witch be one my favorite T.V show life :D i use watch back back episode everyday when i get home school . so far i think i have watch episode least once and whole series 3 or 4 time . Melissa Joan Hart play perfect teenage girl/witch normal teenager trouble can all relate . be funny , smart , outgoing , witty , and lot more . Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick both fit part very well Sabrina 's aunt . Zelda , intelligent scientist , and Hilda crazy , wacky one make perfect balance Sabrina 's life . i must agree college year be n't as good her high school year , but that do n't mean be n't still good . think end be awesome be notwhat i hope , make sense and i love anyways . : )
This be perhaps well rockumentary ever- British , well I Spinal Tap . character be believable , plot be great , and can genuinely empathise events- such Ray 's problem fitting band.The soundtrack be excellent . real period stuff , even be same key , will be hum song day . what like be nearly all-British cast , favourite household name . Ray 's wife be priceless ... film never drag , just go right pace , and have genuinely funny section . generator really good catchphrases ! be hidden diamond .
 Hilarious , evocative , confusing , brilliant film . remind Bunuel 's L'Age D'Or or Jodorowsky 's Holy Mountain -- lot strange character muck about and look ... . . what be ? laugh almost whole way through , all while keep peripheral eye bewilder and occasionally horrify reaction audience surround theatre . entertain through and through , beginning gut and poison entrails all way end , be end . only wish i could remember detail . haunt sometimes.Honestly , though , i have only most positive recollection film . do n't seem be available take home and watch , i suppose i will have wait few more year Crispin Glover come my way again his Big Slide Show ( and subsequent " what be ? " screen ) ... see film Atlanta almost directly be involve rather devastating car crash , i be slightly daze time , which be perhaps very good state mind watch prophetic talk arthropod and retard superhero costume and godlike Glover his appropriate burly-Q setting , scantily clad girlie rise out floor magnificent DADAist wet dream.Is statement Life know ? course everyone EXPECTS art be just that . rather think truth be more evident absence and negative space . what do n't tell be what must deduce , but be far more valid lie other people feed day and day out . rather " what be ? " 5000 movie " Titanic " or " Sleepless Seattle " ( shudder , gag , groan).Thank , Mr. Glover ( additionally fun man watch screen or his Big Slide Show -- smart , funny , quirky , and outrageously hot ) . make more film , write more book , keep nightmare alive .

Robert DeNiro be superb man whose intelligence and goodness begin fail world indifferent his ability . be first have see DeNiro use tenderness rather toughness sell character and really like . film be big surprise when first view and look forward see again .

 Yes , be horror anthology film and be lot fun ! be film clearly be horror , story have light spirit--and there be even occasionally few laugh . be n't all bad thing sometimes horror film be bit stuffy and overly serious . and four story be pretty good , be one good movie style have seen.The unifying theme that connect story be house . Four different story involve people who either rent home or investigate what happen tenants.The first segment star Denholm Elliott horror writer who have writer 's block . so , change scenery , rend house . almost immediately Elliott 's block vanish and work steadily tale serial killer . amazingly , soon his block vanish begin actually see his fictional character ! again and again , psychotic killer appear and then disappears--making seem as be lose his mind . might just be good story , nice twist ending make story come alive.The second , notbad , be probably weak . Peter Cushing play bachelor who be pine girl friend who die time ago ( picture look amazingly contemporary ) . when enter chamber horror wax museum town , see wax figure that remind his lose lady and be fascinate and scare . later , friend ( Joss Ackland ) visit and , too , see figure and be entrance . all lead ending , frankly , be bit letdown.Christopher Lee then star incredibly harsh and stern father pathetic little girl . most segment , Lee seem idiot , but end can understand his demeanor . slow , one end very well.The fourth segment be silly and be mean parody genre . Jon Pertwee ( third " Doctor " DR . who television series ) be very temperamental actor know his portrayal Dracula . however , nothing be right film accord and fit pique , stomp off set find good prop vampire film . be actually pretty interesting play role , seem natural Christopher Lee who play Dracula or other vampire bazillion time ( give or take few ) . enjoy Pertwee 's line when basically say Lee 's and other recent incarnation Dracula be crap compare Bela Lugosi 's ! perhaps be why Lee do n't take part ! very silly moment , be very entertaining and fun--possibly as good or well first segment.Considering film start and end so well , have excellent act and write , be hard notlike film .
all film noir 1940s and 1950s , have rank one strange , and most fun watch . say four main actor : Orson Welles , Rita Hayworth , Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders.The first two name be familiar everyone but be last two that make movie so entertaining , especially Anders . his character , " George Grisby , " be one strange people have ever see film . his voice , and thing say , have be hear be believe . Slaone be n't far " strange " category . Hayworth be notas glamorous short , blonde hair but still be Hayworth , which mean lot ogle be guy . Welles ' be as fascinating always . One tip : have DVD , turn English subtitle . his character movie be Irishman and need subtitle understand everything says.Welles also direct film which mean have great camera angle and wonderful facial closeup . also have unique ending , visually , shootout house mirror . great stuff ! as bizarre film be , still think buffoon-like carnival atmosphere trial end be too much and take away seriousness scene . other , complaints.This be great entertainment , which be name game .
This be incredible comeback movie director mastermind , Tsui Hark . be one few movie that deserve come face face match Steven Chow 's Shaolin Soccer . moment movie started,there be astronishing backdrop edge which weredeplicted superb style . be science fiction or Chinese martial art " geek " , will love excessive amount many 3D effect and realistic computer generate weapon . there , come fine performance(as always ) Ekin Cheung who play " Sky King " . team up Louis Koo(Red) who i be very impress his flexible " wing " which deflect incoming attack . fight movement actor be proficient way . notonly be action superb but have somewhat complex storyline . many criticiser movie complain lack story/theme or just " shove random bit debrise " and even describe " Legend Poo " . however , viewer can rely watch Dragon Ballz and other similar Manga Cartoons understand movie . other who be famarialy " Wu Xia " movie will have good appoach . due respect . there can be one weakness that could be foresee . blow that be deliveried enemy very last fight scene could be more substantially and devastiingly made.In spite all , its must see .
just ca n't understand negative comment film . yes be typical boy-meets-girl romance but be do such flair and polish time just fly . Henstridge ( talk win gene-pool lottery ! ) be as magnetic and alluring as ever ( who say golden age cinema be dead ? ) and Vartan hold his own.There be simmer chemistry two lead ; film be most alive when share scene - lot ! be do so well find willing get together ... ignore negative comment - be feel bit blue , watch flick , will feel so much well . be already happy , then will be euphoric.(PS : be 33 , Male , UK and hopeless romantic still search his Princess ... )
story and music ( George Gershwin ! ) be wonderful , as be Levant , Guetary , Foch , and , course , Kelly . One thing be miss , and thing be good lead lady . be sorry , Leslie Caron bother . anyway , , plot move along nicely famous ( and deservedly so ) Ballet . oh colour , dazzling red , blue , green , and yellow . mu n't forget beige as well . ; ) just adore contrast Beaux Arts Ball ( completely black and white costume ) and ever-so-brilliant Ballet.So suppose what be try say be : please , mean see , and enjoy , be n't good , be marvelous . but be sure notforget other Gene Kelly musical 20 year old girl that be catapult stardom just afterward .
do n't waste time read my review . go out and see astonishingly good episode , which may very well be good Columbo ever write ! Ruth Gordon be perfectly cast scheming yet charming mystery writer who murder her son-in-law avenge his murder her daughter . Columbo be his usual rumple , befuddle and far-cleverer-than-he-seems self , and particular installment feature fantastic chemistry Gordon and Falk . ironically , be notwrite herald creator Levinson or Link yet be possibly dense , most thoroughly original and twist-laden Columbo plot ever . utterly satisfy nearly department and overflow droll and witty dialogue and thinking . truly unexpected and inventive climax top all . positive ... seek one out Netflix !
This be second Baby Burlesk short be release , and probably most popular one , be spoof 1926 silent film what Price Glory.I watch and do notunderstand kiddie-porn that be be claim . be just cute little film . have see family show grow up watch ' 80 be and ' 90 have that have little girl dress more provocatively act ' mature manner ' . be more provocative WERE N'T dress diaper . there be nothing provocative diaper have one fetish . ( just joke ) read description movie and where state only pedophile would enjoy watch . be sick . , watch and be bother , then maybe need look your own psyche and try figure out why bother . be innocent film that be make parody film . B.B. film be parody , nothing more . parodies/spoofs today be graphic nature and have true almost pornographic scene and quite vile language . should n't be more appalling ? can watch issue , but sometimes take child 's story and turn filth parody . be what should get your skin . notbabified ( notword , know ) adult movie 1926 , know how pornographic silent film be , Huh ? notmention ' Forbidden Hollywood Pre-Code era film ' so vile and filthy . would Never make such filth today ? ( note sarcasm )
enjoy film . think be excellent political thriller something that be never happen - secret Service agent go bad and involve assassination plot . unfortunately , Michael Douglas ' character , " Pete Garrison , " think He be mole but isn't.He be just morally-flawed agent have affair First Lady ! be do , be unable give acceptable polygraph exam and that make suspect number one when have reveal there be plot kill President."Garrison " be force go lam but same time be still try do right thing protect President . Douglas do fine job role . do n't always care people play but be excellent actor . Keifer Sutherland ( " David Breckinridge " ) be equally as good ( least here ) fellow SS boss who hunt down Douglas convinced have be tell truth . when do two work together finale discover and then stop , can , plot . crook be interesting , too , way . also , have never - and never will , unfortunately - see First Lady who look as good Kim BasingerThis be simply slick action flick that entertain start-to-finish . be there hole ? course ; probably number , and reason see so many critical comment . however , be unfairly bash here . just be n't intelligent enough genius here website . my advice : chill , just go along ride and enjoy all action and intrigue . yes , get little Rambo-ish end but otherwise get high mark entertainment ... ..which be what movie be all about .
think be awesome movie . theme song be sweet ! : ) Anyway , only thing that somewhat bother be beginning , when everything should have be normal . be very weird and unrealistic . big cable company be mainly what be talk about . apart , movie be very creative . think all act be well do , actor act out their character ' personality perfectly . everything fit together well . really be shame their be n't soundtrack . would have be great ! be Canadian film , and be one my favorite , give movie 10 out 10 !
be so glad come short film . be always so disappoint short film be hard come across , so when see and see be nominate Live Action Short Film Academy Awards , be so please actually have film be root for.The plot be pretty simple , director , writer , and star Nacho Vigalondo try come up reason people would suddenly break out song and dance number do movie musical . result be extremely entertaining and song be actually really catchy.It be well make short film , well edit and actor all do great job . and last shot film be perfect.I highly recommend film .
A winter day , 28th December 1986 , two bore 14 year old hire movie . " Hmmmm , Police Story , look interesting " , " who be Jackie Chan ? " , " never hear " .

" Erendira " be film Mexico that be rarely talk about . film only exist low quality VBS format . be shame film have n't be give DVD release . " Erendira " be stunning and gorgeous its magic-realist image . " Erendira " be base short story novel " 100 year solitude " . Erendira be constantly daydream and accidentally burn down her grandma 's house . her evil grandma , play Irene Papas , force prostitution pay damage . whole town get piece Erendira , so speak . subject matter sound harsh , film do n't exploit sexuality . be do mature artistic manner . film also have amazing costume . more surreal aspect film that stand out most , be origami bird morph real bird , and golden orange diamond center . Erendira be amazing film , that even manage throw humor . be definitely film that deserve special DVD release . will say espanol , " E muy muy bien ! ! ! Excellente !
@card@ BBC production " Jane Eyre " star Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton ( Love HIM ) have always be and will always be my favorite Jane Eyre . watch other version Jane Eyre read book , will be watch regular movie which will forget next day . but watch one almost equal read book . use watch miniseries lot when be little , and inspire read book . time do n't pay attention how close television production be book . recently , watch 1996 version Jane Eyre and be very disappoint . be only 2 hour long and do n't have many important scene book ( such my favorite Gypsy scene ) . fall love " Jane Eyre " even more include all important scene book and just tell whole story( other version do n't , have n't read book).The cast 1983 Jane Eyre be excellent . be true Timothy Dalton be very handsome actor ( handsome enough play Butler " Scarlet " , and Julius Caesar ) , but be so great Rochester ca n't imagine anybody else play role . and Zelah Clarke be , doubt , only Jane that follow description book . other thing that make film so great be clothes and makeup actor . Jane look so modest and naive , just Bronte describe her ( do n't look 18 , but do actually pay attention ? ... )Some people say " Jane Eyre " be too long , but would rather spend my whole day watch spend 2 hour watch other version . say movie be dull and boring Jane be notpassionate enough , or there be notenough " kissing scene " . hate when make Jane Eyre " Hollywood movie " inappropriate kissing scene . do n't have include " crazy , madly love " scene show love Jane and Rochester . and Zelah and Timothy express love so perfectly there be other scene need ! ! be 19 year old , and many girl my age refer film " boring and old-fashioned " . but can only feel sorry do n't appreciate purity and beauty . , novel be set 19th century , and old-fashioned look make more attractive and more book.I do n't think there will ever be other version Jane Ayre that will have popularity and love one . matter who play Jane and Rochester other movie , real Jane and Rochester ( least ) will always be Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton !
one my favorite movie which have be overlook too many movie goer , observation which mystify . notonly direct acclaimed Ang Lee,it have many young actor who be become major star , e.g. , Tobey Maguire ( Spiderman ) , Skeet Ulrich ( Jericho ) , Jonathan Rhys Meyers ( Tudors ) , James Caviezel , Simon Baker , Mark Ruffalo , Jeffrey Wright , Tom Wilkinson , and Jewel . act be superb and actor mention give memorable performance , especially Meyers who portray evil villain who kill sake killing.When biography and accomplishment director ( even when win academy award ) and actor be list , film be usually omit their past performance . discover film DVD accident and become one my most often watch film . however , be seldom see cable . look forward read what other suggest be reason film be notwell know .
catch movie my local movie channel , and i rather enjoy watch film . have all element good teen film , and more - film , aside deal boys-girls relationship and sex and like , also deal issue steroid use young people.The film have real-life feel - loud music , special effect and outrageous scene - which , movie , be right . feel make easy relate character film - which probably know where live.Overall , good movie , fun watch.positive
even be quite young , Beatles be my ABSOLUTELY FAVOURITE band ! never have chance hear their music be release but have love can remember.It be sort film that be worth try once . can see why be n't release cinema but be certainly great film put TV . be flick my TV guide and happen see film , do n't much detail something , ' John Lennon and Paul McCartney meet Beatles have break up , Jared Harris Stars ' . have never hear ( play John ) or Aiden Quinn who play Paul . however be certainly underestimate actor ! film have slow start but develop , could see how well Quinn but especially Harris play their character . huge fan , sort know what real Lennon and McCartney be like . script be brilliant and Harris get Lennon 's accent , personality and mannerism spot on ! Quinn play McCartney quite well but sometimes go his Irish accent . make-up artist make look excellent.THIS Paragraph May Be COUNTED *SPOILER*:As mention before , get off slow start but soon develop and become quite emotional film . find bit park total waste time and quite out character musician . as Lennon 's rude line Italian restaurant , totally unnecessary . end be very poignant and bring tear my eye whenever watch it.It be quite different other biographical film have see where be about how Beatles get together and become famous , and never really do character that well . e.g. ' Backbeat'.In conclusion , would say , be Beatles or John Lennon or Paul McCartney fan , give chance may have pleasent surprise . only about 95 minute long , be worth wait film develop.If anyone do know meeting 1976 really do happen please send the ' comment page ' film , will be very interested .
see show 3-4 year ago . be dam funny ! when i first time i see be play ETV(Estonian Television ) and i start like . too bad show be bad time . Hyde be cool guy who like sing Frank Sinatra ! and come stupid idea . get glass which h be brown . like . and there be Fez . group Pervert . all know what do when his alone ... . . want get lay badly . even have his boss one episode.His India . and there be Michael , stupid guy whole group , probably stupid town and his cop ! be so stupid i remember follow : Hyde say : do u call cop ? - Michael come and say . do anyone know how turn off siren ? be town playboy . then come Jackie , who be former girlfriend Michael and then be Hyde 's girlfriend . then be Eric who be son grumpy war veteran and son Kitty housewife . his one big pussy . but love Donna , his girlfriend who plan be marriage . Donna be one hot girl . hmm what i forget ? ah Hyde life basement .
read negative comment view film and undeterred , go ahead and start watch . admit have rewind quite few time film be incredibly complex , involved and full detail . be good thing but also , quite unexpected culture car chase , explosion , gratuitous sex and general violence substitute plot and character development . fact , what welcome departure , however , be so use notpay lot attention what watch.This film be chock full character development and plot line ; kind use analyze when be high school . require actual mental participation part viewer . what nice change . would compare ' all President 's Men ' term generic subject matter . be , be mystery intense misconduct part elect official and enough influence official essentially ' own ' them.Unlike ' all President 's Men ' , film make effort give couple character actual personality . sense movie be character study ' Negotiatior ' Samuel Jackson and Kevin spacey . movie , their character be city employee and plot be extremely intense . yet , plot be dependent ability their character cooperate other , trust , and ultimately unite together corrupt Police Department . there be more gun fire film and specific plot be different but generically , there be many similarities.I Will say City Hall require whole lot more concentration . fact , be strike how parallel be past and present political scandal have see my life go back Watergate . thing be , public know something be wrong , sure ! but follow detail be hard do . movie be noteven close be as complex real life but actually be realistic life its complexity . think that be one reason previous poster have criticize film : unrealistic expectations.If one watch know what be about see and be up experience , really be excellent ! watch 3 time row ! acting be superb and directing be flawless . weak link be John Cusak 's accent .
love film recognize intelligence viewer , allow layer peel character their interaction other unspoken loss that have so affect them.The cinematography be beautiful , and be inspired reflection vision someone believe be extremely talented new filmmaker maturity and artistic insight tell story other much more experience have fail accomplish . see bright future writer/producer/director who have ability focus goal and accomplish integrity.Kudos achievement .
The 1967 Cold Blood be perhaps more " real thing " ( think : would really want see real thing ? ) , but be black and white color world , and lot people do n't even know what be , and there be opportunity remake television . plus , remake , can show stuff notshow original . book Cold Blood Truman Capote be first " nonfiction novel " . Truman 's book be fact not100 % true real story . think Canadian location suffice Kansas pretty much TV movie . look element sex , drug and rock ' n ' roll : Dick be womanize , Perry be aspirin junkie , Perry playing blue guitar .
Jake 's Closet have emotional power Kramer vs. Kramer combine imagination Pan 's Labyrinth . even begin special effect seem give nod Pan 's Labyrinth . but be story that take place modern time , notwar sixty year ago and way have even more resonance today . Jake 's closet be about boy , only child , practically alone summer vacation , deal his family fall apart . be horror movie other and Sixth sense , horror movie think person . be look slasher movie , wo n't be your cup tea but be look story that be touching and suspenseful good acting , be movie . screening see , swear there be one moment where entire audience scream . highly recommend catch film .
how can anyone argue fact Urban Cowboy be , and still be , good document Texas life time period . consider following : man beat their wife , get drunk bar nightly , get marry settle fight , commit adultery , and compete mechanical bull . try and name movie that depict real life so vividly . dont make anymore . seem current film be always people lot money , live huge home , drive expensive car and do n't work . movie have celebration scene get trailer pete 's sake ! anyway , watch least week . no kid . have dissect movie end end . feel free email learn more my reason call documentary . consider follow scene : Bud see Sissy - be split up - amicably honk and wave , flip bird - return half peace sign honk his horn add impact then tear off.Buds mom call approx. 18 hour get town , Sunday , see have job yet - all have accomplish be get drunk and laid(x2) , help his uncle and aunt who cover him."You live like pig " think about why scene be need . think . be necessary ? could notfigure out show filthy sink ? God love that ! Sissy allow Wes help ride bull . only few day ( or possibly next day ) Wes just kick crap out her husband . Steve ask - Hey Sissy , remember Wes ? oh yeah , didnt beat my husband other night , so let be get lesson goin ' , make mention fact seek solace later one Bud and Sissy 's many fight , which way all take place public - Gilley 's ! wedding reception picture take session ( oh humanity ! ) could least arrange or move chair out way . " my leg be sweatin ' momma"In conclusion , do n't put scene movie try and show insight human psychology . be documentary real life.I only wish there be director 's cut ... .
film be really cool . thing look come out comic book . set , costume , and plot be great . Clark Bartram be again our favorite batman . look bit well dead end , but still pull off . superman be great too . fly effect be OK . but its fan-film cant expect be great . shot superman catch car be VERY believable . be cool . be movie i would definitely see be real . its get thing would want batman/ superman movie . one exception though , i would cast joker instead 2-face ... . . overall i give film 10 its great film .
first word which come my mind watch movie be " beauty " . beauty be all around , actor ' play ( Andie be superb as always ) , well design shot , and author ' red line idea - Love.I think Kenny 's character be only white spot three womens ' otherwise boring and predictable life . his interaction make Andie 's character living entertain could possibly be . when be go , become obvious can really appreciate and hold our inner believe and sacred desires.The fact Andie successfully recover loss be nothing bad , instead show life prevail form , even small British village , which be show perfectly.Another reason love movie be be so British way - all house and " fag " and accent : ) ) ) . and Andie again be do superb job ! be shame movie get such low mark . 10 out ten !

Farrah Fawcett be superb powerful 1986 drama , where play Marjorie , woman who manage escape clutch would-be rapist . well do Farrah be Golden Globe ' Best Actress ' nominee.When her rapist Joe ( terrifically play James Russo ) come her home , which share her two roommate ( who be conveniently out ! ) , Marjorie have play along Joe 's frightening demand . do make disturbing and shocking image ! when her roommate come home , be astound ( say least ) Marjorie 's action , and great performance Alfre Woodard who desperately try convince Marjorie do right thing and turn police , make film even more nail-biting.I do find Diana Scarwid quite irritate , but when Joe finally admit come there kill , make film very emotional piece drama indeed.Overall , Extremities be brilliantly thought-out and well-act movie and must have watch hundred time now ! well do everybody involve .
The Stone Boy be almost forget drama 1980s . consider how many famous or soon be famous people be film , wonder how could have be so overlook . be slow , moody , but touch account tragedy that befall farm family . film be more or less indictment Midwestern stoic value and suppression emotion . film will notbe taste , but anyone who can appreciate real human drama should like OK.In early moment film , see two brother head off early morning hour pick pea and maybe shoot duck or two be lucky . climb barbed wire fence , gun accidentally discharge and young boy fatally shoot his old brother . boy have apparently never take hunter safety course . way two man properly go fence one gun would be as follow : first man climb through . second man then pass gun fence . first man then set gun down and help other fence . time should either man have his hand both gun and fence.Anyway , once his brother be kill , 12-yr-old Arnold regress his own world . do noteven run help his brother be shoot . simply go ahead and pick pea and tell his family accident later . point funeral or inquest do Arnold seem show regret or sorrow . his family seem shun . perhaps be even angry kill his brother . ornery uncle play Frederick Forrest be outwardly upset Arnold , even old brother 's death allow hit kid 's girlfriend . Arnold 's parent do n't seem understand how deal their son . really do n't even try talk . only person can communicate be his grandfather who be play typical grandfatherly skill Wilford Brimley . while , Arnold even move old timer.Nothing seem get Arnold open up take bizarre road trip Reno Nevada inexplicably look up his uncle 's ex-wife . once meet , begin emerge his shell apologize break up her marriage start family 's turmoil accident . here on , film become quick study reconciliation and reawakening.The acting be hauntingly distant most case . Robert Duvall and Glenn Close make perfect stoic farm parent . Forrest be good , but maybe try too hard channel Paul Newman 's performance Hud . cinematography be exceptional , too . like moody picture common folk , one may be . even may be advise bring tissue . 8 10 stars.The hound .
critic be dumb . movie be funny and smart . love movie lot . why do everyone hate movie so much . wish people would love movie more do n't . Ben Stiller and Jack Black be true comedian and put lot work make movie . do n't see people there make movie . so people should just watch and notcomment . like movie . be OK all . there be part be get be dumb but least make . Jerry Stiller would love movie have act just show king Queens . but be good . ca n't believe be rate so low .

celebration Earth Day Disney have release film " Earth " . stop far short strident message gloom and doom , be treat excellent footage animal their habitat feel too bad ourselves.The star show be herd elephant , family polar bear and whale and its calf . narrative begin North Pole and proceed south reach tropic , all while be introduce denizen various climatic zone traversed.Global warming be mention view wandering polar bear ; note be make shrink sea ice island more recent year . never see bear catch seal , but father 's desperate search food lead dangerous solution.The aerial shot caribou migrate tundra be one most spectacular wildlife shot ever see ; and migrate wildfowl be enough reward price admission see big screen.One disappointment feel be otherwise terrific shot great white shark take seal be film slow motion . never do get sense one characteristic wild animal ; their incredible speed . idea slow down film convey great quickness think begin ( or least be first recall see ) television show " Kung Fu " early Seventies.An interesting sidelight be credit roll end demonstration cinematographic technique employ be reveal . there be enough dramatic , humorous and instructive moment movie make solid choice nature buff . perhaps selective edit ( spare , be , grisly end prey-predator moment ) and fact footage have be release 2007 and be available DVD be solid film its own right . and can take your kid ! Three star .
wo n't give anything away describe plot film other say begin return Israel young blind woman whose close friend and companion have just commit suicide . unfold detective story blind woman try figure out why her friend end her life . pursue her investigation and information accumulate , lead inexorably devastating conclusion . film be expertly pace and acting , especially Talia Sharon Ya'ara , blind woman , be excellent .

Harvey Keital 's good performance so far new century . very nicely photograph , beautiful snap-shot pre-Castro Cuba . story revolve nephew local minor crime boss who develop friendship American Hollywood connection . be really moment when boy awaken fact small circle people know actually live much large , much more complex world do n't yet understand.the script be strong and fill humor , direction be crisp . , really professional job that fit well tradition Latin American cinema . one weakness be decision shoot sync-sound English rather Spanish - probably improve sale US . unfortunately , just make film little less convincing . but can see , will find heartfelt trip world . recommend .
Chinese movie make feel so many similarity member culture do n't belong and be far . almost Buddhist approach , film help relate character , and happiness do simple routine things.All actor be brilliant , and Xu Hzu exude kindness and wisdom , yet also vulnerable and mean . er Min , retarded brother , show intelligence and wisdom be notequal , and wisdom come and most disparate person universe . different China , be far Chinese realism , yet , have lot humanity and realism different kind.Get . wo n't be disappoint .

" Addictive " be adjective have hear many time when talk certain TV show . most recently , dramas Lost , Heroes and Prison break have earn description . however , as compelling may be ( and really be ) can wait few day see next episode series , even Prison break which some have lazily classify " new 24 " . due respect , there can be such thing , and good reason : other silver-screen thriller be base real-time structure . be what set 24 apart other show , and be why practically have watch entire season ( DVD ) seven day or less : once frickin ' clock start tick , be impossible tune out.An episode whose event unfold course single day be trademark NYPD Blue ( and , more recently , Deadwood ) ; have entire season new series last 24 hour , one ep ( actual run time be 41 minute ; remaining 19 be occupy commercial when show air telly ) , be most groundbreaking idea mainstream television Hill Street Blues introduce non-linear storytelling ( mandatory element nowadays ) . and truly pay off.Ironically enough , original plan series be make revolve around wedding ( fortunately , creator Joel Surnow and Robert Cochran realize format be more suitable conspiracy thriller ) , which be probably reason first glimpse get hero suggest cheerful atmosphere : look extremely relax , Jack Bauer ( Kiefer Sutherland ) be enjoy game chess his daughter Kimberly ( Elisha Cuthbert ) and , minute later , being tender Teri ( Leslie Hope ) , wife whom have just reconcile . as Sopranos , though , something unexpected and shocking be just corner : notonly have Kim sneak out her room , Jack also receive phone call urge get work immediately . midnight ? be afraid so : Bauer be CTU ( Counter Terrorist Unit ) agent , and his boss have acquire reliable intel possible hit life David Palmer ( Dennis Haysbert ) , African-American Presidential candidate who will be Los Angeles whole day ( oh , right , almost forget : event occur day California Presidential Primary ) . time nap , then : Jack have spend next 24 hour work case . unfortunately , have tendency ignore protocol , and that do n't sit well George Mason ( Xander Berkeley ) , slimy man Division who have be ask interfere operation.The plot be very dense , make show hard recommend short attention span , but anyone willing take look will be reward instantly : writing be sharp and precise , attention detail unsurpassed , and suspense be consistently sky-high , mainly thanks real-time trickery which considerably enhance adrenaline level.Another great quality pilot be characterization : most genre show ( sci-fi and thriller ) tend simply introduce key player and then define late ( textbook example be CSI , where character development be minimal , but then again match show 's unique style ) , series debut 24 offer rich array fully rounded people , whom Jack ( Sutherland 's good role - ever ! ) and Palmer ( real revelation show ) stand out be perfectly describe one episode only ( former divide job and family , reckless but humane , latter honorable and endow great integrity ) . couple support part border stereotype ( Mason and Tony Almeida especially ) , but two factor ought be take account : ) be first episode ; b ) there be so much go most viewer wo n't even complain " flaw " or two . , how many network program manage begin conspiracy , missing teenager and huge explosion - and still have equally satisfying material rest season ? tick , tock , tick , tock ...

Frank Sinatra 's first three film , be purely speciality act : ostensibly play , merely show up croon song nightclub sequence somebody else 's movie . his fourth film , very enjoyable ' Higher and Higher ' , Young Blue eye transition act career play actual role ... task make easy be play fictional story that give chance croon few numbers.Sinatra 's entrance be quite funny . Michele Morgan hear knock door , and ask who be there . outside , Hoboken-toned voice answer ' Frank Sinatra ' . sure enough ... opening credit ' Higher and Higher ' may confuse viewer , name songwriter Rodgers and Hart be prominently display . fact , only contribute one song musical : ' Disgustingly Rich ' , which cast manage toss off sort intro entirely different song , ' be Debutante ' . interestingly , Rodgers & Hart song -- one their weak -- be perhaps least enjoyable song movie 's score ; several other be lively up-tempo number , notably ' be most important Affair ' , ' when come love , be your Own ' and ' I Saw First'.Sinatra 's good movie , but would do good work ( and sing good material ) elsewhere . real merits ' Higher and Higher ' be delightful turn performer who rarely make film . Paul and Grace Hartman be extremely popular husband-wife dance team who star several Broadway revue : genuinely graceful ballroom dancer , put plenty physical comedy their dance material . ( here , Grace do high kick that knock shoe out Paul 's hand . ) Grace Hartman , who die cancer age 48 , do almost film work , so be real pleasure film give rare chance see her close-up , hear her beautiful singing voice and notice how sexy look her maid 's uniform . Grace Hartman 's death , her husband have long career character actor , just occasionally dance solo . ( or Ken Berry one memorable episode ' Mayberry RFD'.)Also quite attractive maid 's uniform here ' Higher and Higher ' be vivacious teenage singer Marcy McGuire . why do n't talented girl make more movie ? perhaps be just bit too similar personality Betty Hutton . enjoy Hutton 's performance but like Marcy McGuire even well . end ' Higher and Higher ' there be amusing bit physical business feature McGuire and Mary Wickes waitress , take turn move table table nightclub . alternate stride short McGuire and tall gawky Wickes be hilarious ! regrettably , Leon Errol play large role ' Higher and Higher ' , be give almost comedy business : notonce do do his famous rubber-legged dance . Jack Haley , his prominent billing , be also wasted.Very well-represent here be Dooley Wilson , inevitably remember Sam ' Casablanca ' . film , Wilson do his own singing but fake his keyboard performance ' Time Goes By ' . ( real life , Wilson could n't play piano . ) here ' Higher and Higher ' , sing pleasingly and give amusing reaction other player . less enjoyable be Mel Odious , mean Mel Torme . Victor Borge give rare film performance here , handle his dialogue deftly but never do keyboard comedy which later do successfully his stage shows.The plot ? forget . ' Higher and Higher ' be nobody 's idea ' great ' musical , but be enjoyable delight , and will rate 8 10 . Director Tim Whelan , who work Britain well as Hollywood , deserve be much well know .

( there be n't much way spoiler , there be n't plot reveal , but still , guess describe what happen so ... ) be . be most nonsensical film have ever see . there be simply word describe movie , " bizarre " " ridiculous " and " ego trip " be pretty close . opening half hour or so be really , really weird music video , absolutely plot or continuity , apart MJ fall previous . One highlight part " film " section where MJ be fly merry-go-round aeroplane what seem be half-arsed bond intro reject and section cut Yellow Submarine ( dear lord could notmake up).Then , little hour remain , " film " begin , lot claymation ( really creepy ) spot our " hero " and chase look autograph . obviously , leave our as yet mute ( discounting song ) lead somewhat worried , and manage temporarily lose . fortunate , mean can witness fall star and , and again , be notmake up , turn claymation rabbit . use cunning disguise try and sneak , but , reason ca n't recall right now , see ( oh no ! ) and creepy chase begin again . cue song ( big shock there).Shortly end chase , MJ somehow bring rabbit life , be bust policeman ( middle desert ) be , apparently , illegal dance there.The rest film be equally as strange , highlight include MJ clean up bar tune Smooth Criminal , include shoot man his finger , notonly kill guy , but burn his shadow wall , la nuclear fission weapon . good moment be when MJ , see , Mr Big ( Joe " what hell happen his career point ? " Peschi ) kidnap one child be friend , magically create tommy gun , and moment violence that pepper film seemingly random , open fire everything move . final moment shall mention be when MJ , surround Mr Big and his private army . seriously , guy have dozen people work , and be deck more commando unit rather mobster , which guess be . how do get out ? why , turn robot , complete weapon and shield . be third four transformation make , almost always when back corner and/or run.This film be quite , quite surreal , little way plot , and virtually continuity .

John Forsythe also do good turn Alvin Dewey , chief detective investigate crime , as do Gerald S. O'Laughlin his assistant . tactic that be faithful Capote 's book and good artistic gambit all around , Brooks do notshow murder beginning ; instead , show two killer pull up Clutter house last light go out , then cut next morning and horrify discovery body . only ride back Kansas , when Blake be question Forsythe and narrate story , do see true horror what happen night . do n't see much blood be spill scene , but do n't need . shotgun blast and horrify look Clutters ' face know be about die be more disturbing enough , there be need resort explicitly bloody slasher-film violence.Brooks wisely film Cold Blood stark black-and-white , and result be excellent thanks Conrad Hall 's expertise . chilling jazz score Quincy Jones be capper . end result be one most unsettling film kind ever make , devastating its own low-key fashion . be 134-minute study crime that shake entire state and indeed entire nation , and should be see , viewer discretion be advise ; ' R ' rating be there reason .

movie have be my favorite time . its notsuppose have plot , its maker want people ( Charlie Sheen , think)to believe be real snuff film . be exercise visual effect , and do n't cut away when action happen other film do . movie day be now all sound effect , leave visual be make computer cause its easy deal CGI blood . there still be movie maker who still ca n't get fake blood look real thing . there be rape scene that be n't point make film . have see hill have eye 2 ? rape scene be funny instead shocking . i be sure there be Gonzo porn film maker that have try marry porn horror . but probably suck make film , probably would n't be able pull off . movie " Baise Moi " have disturbing rape scene actress be actually porn star and show everything even movie overall sucks.Its too bad movie ca n't be make think money aspect , especially when talk AO or NC-17 rating . be sure Eli Roth have ability/talent make his Hostel film series much much good , but have too tame down get R rating ... or least hope his movie suck limitations.Watch Traces Death or more Smashed Pumpkins want frill real footage ( accident & crime scenes/footage ) . do n't forget movie be make 1985 . fact film can still stand up most crap make day say lot film . would be someone say 8bit Super Mario Brothers suck PS3 have good graphics .
This be one good series , rank up there Resident Evil 3 : nemesis ( or Biohazard : last escape ) game have very good storyline which play Claire Redfield search her brother,Chris Redfield ( Whom probably know original Resident Evil ) be as scary other Resident Evil , and contain alot more cutscenes.My rating : **** ***** Stars ( rating base comparison other videogames )

Nick Zano be very hot and funny , as well ' Gary ' , Wesley Jonathan . whole cast be great , character have their own personality and charm . Jennie Garth , Allison Munn , and Leslie Grossman be very interesting . especially love ' Lauren ' ; be good ! help make show extra funny and never know what be gonna do or say next ! overall show be really nice but reason do n't give 10 be there be more new episode and episode could have be long and more deep .
be what i call great movie . live trough fantastic actor skill and simple but human story . there be real character which can be funny and dramatic . but main theme be very cruel , live is.the bus driver and his son be collect people trough country ( jugoslavia ) their way capital Belgrad . funny and cruel situation that happen way , connect people and pig that travel together.watch and gonna remember life ... its fill Slavic humor and lifestyle.and reason its magic : be hard get ! !
have hear people who say movie be dull dull dull . do n't think be watch right movie . be n't prototypical action movie , thank God.This be psychological drama rookie and his mentor that just happen be about kill people . way work extremely well , terrific performance Berenger and Zane ( who do n't sleepwalk movie have other role - actually look 's acting).I be disappoint action end - lot do n't make much sense and be unsatisfy give buildup rest movie . but watch Zane 's face panic , alone , Berenger do dirty work .

All-in-All give one positive , be that good . ( have n't see special DVD version can comment )
Dog day be one most accurate film i have ever see describe life modern city . be very harsh and cruel point and sadly be very close reality . isolation , desperation , deep emotional dead end , problematic affair , perversion , complex , madness . all thing that be present big advanced city today . make realize once again pityful state which people have lead society.The negative side life city be never picture screen so properly . only wish be lie . unfortunately , be n't . therefore ... positive .
 Watching several time child be quite experience 15 year ago , and now have find again still have film experience few other . risky , be great display moral and life lesson recommend family viewing young kid . still hold up adult , be fortunate have learn many time year ago . try find today be hard enough . . . but believe be well worth no matter what age . Anime fan especially will find great entry Masami Hata 's filmography . impressive art work and unique design , " Chirin No Suzu " represent worthwhile experience . lyrical song be nothot when record English , musical score be nevertheless captivating . but even voice acting be far well much release today . unfortunately be go out print mid-1980 RCA Columbia Home Video , and have notreceive new format release my knowledge , least US . look hard and will be quite satisfy ! be artful , intense , enjoyable , and important landmark Japanese animation .
This be romantic comedy emphasis comedy change . as usual lovers--Sally field almost-over-the-hill soap opera queen , Celeste Talbert ; and Kevin Kline marginally employ and marginally talented actor , Jeffrey Anderson--are work cross purpose , seemingly unaware be madly love , etc. owe little Bette Davis 's Margo Channing All Eve ( 1950 ) and whole lot slapstick theatrical tradition , Sally Field go top hilarity malaprop her way love and happiness . Kevin Kline , one more underrate lead man recent year , be also very good and very win manage be handsome , vulnerable , egotistical and lovable all same time.The misadventure center Celeste 's fear lose her audience have enter her forty , and reach crisis point arrival her niece , aspiring actress Cori Craven ( Elisabeth Shue ) who turn notbe her niece , ensue plot complication . Cori manage get small part soap opera homeless deaf mute discover her true relationship Celeste ( and Jeffrey Anderson well)--but never mind.As romantic counterpoint or foil lead be Robert Downey Jr. ( soap opera director , David Barnes ) and Cathy Moriarty ( Montana and Nurse Nan ) . David Barnes be oh so hot , but care only about one thing : get rid Celeste so might shine more brightly set . end get Barnes do sort thing wreck Celeste 's career , but happenstance and/or perverse logic , all his attempt go awry , much delight viewer.Whoopie Goldberg play Rose Schwartz , show 's chief writer and Celeste 's alter-ego and confidant Carrie Fisher have modest part hard-as-nails producer show.I think be funny only other spoof soap opera world have see ( Young Doctors Love 1982 which burlesque TV 's General Hospital and be pretty good ) . Soapdish be funny daffy script and plenty laugh-out-loud one-liner and terrific performance Field , Kline and Downy , Jr. but see Sally Field who be outstanding .
This be bizzare look Al 's " life " , back when still hyper 20-something . ( real ) home video Al kid be great , and commentary his ( real life ) parent give nice glimpse just how Weird Al wind up screw up be . video be must own devoted Al-coholic .
Rated NR(would be rate R Pervasive Strong Language and Crude Sexual Humor ) . Quebec Rating:16+(should be 13+ ) Canadian Home Video Rating:18AEddie Murphy Delirious be Eddie 's first stand comedy routine.This come out 1983.Back then star movie 48 hrs and Trading Places and be Saturday Night Live.Eddie make two stand comedy films.Delirious and Raw.I prefer Raw just find subject matter be more humorous.Delirious however be also very funny Eddie talk his childhood and make fun celebrity such Mr.T and singer such Michael Jackson.Any fan stand-up comedy film should see Eddie Murphy 's Delirious .
 Vanilla Sky be 2001 remake 1997 movie Abre Los Ojos ( open your eye ) . and my opinion , much more human and emotional version . Tom Cruise play David Aames , selfish egomaniac who take other people 's emotion grant , and think only . Jason Lee play Brian Shelby , David 's good , and many way , only friend . Penelope Cruz play Sofia Serrano , Brian 's girlfriend whom accompany David 's birthday party . Cameron Diaz play Julie Gianni , David 's occasional bed buddy . Kurt Russell play Dr. Curtis McCabe , psychologist interview David . their interaction , and consequence , make Vanilla Sky one most emotional , and complex thriller ever make . wo n't explain anymore plot , be far more compelling , less know . ignore people that call film too confusing follow . pay attention , wo n't be confuse . film be very complex , but notconfusing . and my opinion , one good movie ever make .
movie be just plain fun ... .maybe more fun who be young and fan " Ramones " time film be make . have watch film over and over , and friend , and be still fresh and funny . risk be too serious , concept be big fan certain band be timeless , and high school student boredom drudgery class be just timeless.And , film have gem lines/scenes ... ..references how our " permanent record " high school will follow life .

OK . admit . be one nerd who have spend all many hour my beloved DVD player and my wonderful television set watch science fiction series . Star Trek ( Next Generation ) be my first space date , and then have switch partner regularly . have see , seem , and my favorite be Lexx , Farscape and new Battlestar Galactica , other word : new , state art space opera . but , also have general crush old fashion one , cheap one , magnificent four seasoned BBC show Blakes7 . here , budget be small hobbits , special effect seem be make Commodore 64 , but who care when script be sharp and intelligently write dark humor , act dead serious and time even high class ? but why do always speak English space future ? be notfuture , be fantasy kid . still , can be irritate time . Me , be Norwegian , have often damn appalling fact never make genre series , science fiction , Scandinavian viewer . never ever think fact might have happen . but do , actually , once , and even my own homeland , Norway . be two year old when so call Fjernsynsteatret ( TV theater section ) our national public service channel Nrk produce three episode version Blindpassasjer ( Stowaway).When first hear , be notsurprise fact day , show have only be screen once Norway , make impossible actually see . go Swedish , Danish and Finnish television also , 's time , but be long time ago . there have be video or DVD release , notsurprise either , and when be screen art house cinema , happen Bergen , city far far away Oslo ( where live ) . and then there be fact Blindpassasjer that do n't surprise , be write two Norwegian author Tor ge Bringsvrd and Jon Bing ( Bing&Bringsv ; rd ) . duo basically introduce SciFi genre Norwegian seventy ; publish anthology and write what call fable prose . my opinion , Bringsvrd be most interesting two writer , and have write several great and entertaining novel , masterpiece even , hilarious , such Bazar and Syvsoverskens Dystre Frokost . other guy , also acclaimed dramatist , could construct script Blindpassasjer.When finally get watch , be strange swede who record three episode VCR 80 be , eventually manage transform DVD and give . be nice bloke . so sit down and watch , Swedish subtitle , bad sound and scrape and error ; but thing come through and be surprise eventually come love it.The exterior scene spaceship and planet be good one Blakes7 , and credit go Caprino studio ( who make famous Flklypa Grand Prix ) , and interior Marco Polo ( space ship ) work good have expect . acting be typically theatrical , but work good when play Ibsen , put mildly , and Bjrn Floberg carry his role solidly , as do Trini Lund . legendary actress Henny moan deliver her line serious and lay back tone which fit genre , but be ensemble play , and be happy say Ola B. Johannesen carry his mustache nobility , and Marit stbye be really hot space chic my standards.But be really good ? well , have swallow rather abrupt ending , pretentious criticism modern society , but yes , be , well , notreally really really fantastic , but charming , cool , nostalgic and pleasant . and half hour classic Norwegian SciFi .
be go give 8 , but people make 6.5 out lot good vote , have my contribution . river Styx be pure genius . sure , Woody be his perennial stuff , but least his role be appropriate . first half hour be really hilarious , and then rest movie be easy watch . dialog be clever enough , and Woody 's card trick party , along reaction upper crust , be fun watch . be much good newspaper critic make sound out be . and plus , little Sorcerer 's Apprentice go along . and course , do notice Johansen be get bit frumpy ? Charles Dance be always entertaining , as be Hugh Jackman .
believe lot people down rate movie , notlack quality . but do notfollow standard Hollywood formula . conflict be notresolve . ending be just little too real other , but journey rich character and long list supporter provide be thought provoke and very entertaining . even cinematography be excellent give urban setting , directing also be excellent and innovative.This be 10 my book , movie will take place normal and expect Hollywood script will not. take risk and do few thing different . think work well , be purposely try avoid direct reference movie see be good answer , notaccept someone else 's interpretation .
just see movie other day when rent , and think be go be just movie girl try prove point , but Diane join box want . think movie be good . give positive . be how good be . plus movie Michelle Rodriguez be always good . even be have be only six .

Americans have be characterize gullible rube their element decade , but little have be more blithely unconcerned Leo , who go back his job what gradually look his own customized death train.The story be tell purposely uncoordinated manner film 's Danish director , Lars Von Trier , whose anchor be film 's breathtaking edit and cinematography . shoot black and white and color , use double-exposures , optical effect and trick photography , have actor interact rear-projected footage , place his character richly shaded visceral world that sometimes feel insect , catch glass our more precise survey.This Grand Jury Prize-winning surrealist work be allegorical , but maybe distinct tone viewer . interpret film last leg Nazism , symbolize train , and ethical accountability Americans and other who appear too late salvage martyr train and camp where distribute their condemn shipload . time frame movie , and Nazi state , and such significance train , be dead , but decapitate chicken persist jolt their reflexes.The character , music , dialogue , and plot be deliberately hammy and almost satirically procure film noir convention . most entrance point movie be entirely cinematographic one .

be notbig fan most anime , but Gundam Wing be truly something else . Gundam wing lack stereotypical melodrama might think when think anime , number joke make 17 hour would only be double digit , Gundam Wing get right down business.Gundam Wing be as much political thriller be action series . large part focus diplomatic dealings war , notonly battle . battle animation lack extreme detail case where would just be pain animate , individual duel gundams be almost piece art consider animated use complex mechanic and rapid movements.To my knowledge , 49 episode one movie series be pick up cartoon network 2000 , and then professionally dub too . dubbing be simply flawless . notonly do word say match up , but voice use truly make character much more believable . many believe be good watch anime sub English , but i simply do n't have determination do that.Not only be voice good , but score use series be quite impressive . will just say leave scour net vain find soundtrack.The plot series be what will truly hook viewer , and no , nothook prime time drama Lost which be only make purpose hook . explain plot deeply would lead many spoiler , many character do noteven have name quite few episode series . rough idea series be earth and its now independent space colony be have difficulty maintain peace . thus war be start , lead military coup and elaborate diplomatic situation . feel more detail would begin give away information , which be crucial plot.I will end here say series be great anyone that like anime , anyone that think ALL anime be stupid ( have good reason think ) , and anyone look get anime serious tone .
be overtake emotion . unforgettable rendering wartime story which be unknown most people . performance be faultless and outstanding .
 Visually stunning and full Eastern Philosophy , amazing martial art fantasy be bring master director Tsui Hark , man good film Hong Kong cinema have produce . special effect be beautiful and imaginative . plot be bit cerebral side , but be refresh change film that treat their audience as be moron . thinking be notyour forte , however , may notbe your movie . maybe should go see late Hollywood studio be brain club , but be look something more , be where will find .

THE HOUSE THAT DRIPPED Blood be third series seven Amicus horror anthology . MONSTER Club be include part series , would make eight movie . , movie be very different others.I look Amicus anthology great memory use love when be my teen . my feeling today be just strong.I spend many year try track down movie . synopsis story be so appeal go as far pay substantial amount when eventually find copy . as great movie be , do feel sense disappointment when finally see . be n't quite as good be lead believe . good its two predecessor , be nowhere near good its four successor shall demonstrate.The link story see John Bennett police inspector track down missing person who live mysterious old house . his journey begin local police station where learn story previous occupant . link story later see visit estate agent who sell house . link story seem entice paper , be flat and lifeless practice and easily weak Amicus anthology . could n't help but get feeling John Bennett be poor man 's version Donald Pleasance or Ian Hendry . would much rather have see one two aforementioned actor his role . could have even have both here - one police inspector and estate agent . could , and believe would , have bring weak element movie life much better.The movie contain four story , which focus inhabitant house.The first story see Denholm Elliott writer crime story . be absorb exciting story strangler , even go as far draw sketch aid his writing . soon after , begin see vision his own creation . excellent direction Peter Duffell , particularly choice camera angle help detract restrained script . Elliott 's performance be superb torment writer and also help elevate story . story end semi-twist but could n't help get sense script which do n't allow live up its potential.The second story see Peter Cushing move house . be lonely man who be still pine beautiful young woman who once jilt and who keep picture . Cushing 's performance really bring emotionally-moving story life . be help director who choose include continual focus Cushing 's loneliness . be take further great hallucination scene that help see Cushing 's mind . anyway , Cushing see figure nearby wax museum that look just like his girl . naturally his obsession grow but seemingly romantic story have disturbing twist end . Joss Ackland play Cushing 's rival but his performance be massively overshadow late great Peter Cushing.The third story and easily good see Christopher Lee - my favourite horror actor time - move house his daughter . Mr. Lee give one his perfect ice cold performance here . show love or attention his daughter . even bring school governess educate . governess , play Nyree Dawn Porter her superb performance , try find out what be wrong . give too much away , can reveal witchcraft play role . Christopher Lee 's presence be truly electrify scene be . Chloe Frank deserve special recognition her massively underrate performance little girl who be easily creepy character whole movie . movie be worth see even sake see just one story.The final story be play almost entirely laugh but certainly do entertain and be what matter . Jon Pertwee play horror movie actor who move house . be very dissatisfy approach his producer take movie , see everything cheap and fake , particularly costume . so decide buy authentic cloak his late vampire role . Geoffrey Bayldon have excellent cameo dealer who sell Pertwee ancient cloak . when Pertwee put cloak , start develop fang and basically transform vampire . Pertwee 's performance have be see be believe . truly be hilarious . Ingrid Pitt be also story but her talent be waste role that should have be much larger.The link story finish loose connection final story . be particularly fitting inspector be look Pertwee and naturally decide visit house . rest will be able work out . as weak link story be , do have decent somewhat unintentionally comical ending.I be convince blame shortcoming what should have be truly magnificent movie do n't lie Peter Duffell , director , who really do his good what be get . think script be just too restrained and lack ambition that can be find four late movies.Overall , HOUSE THAT DRIPPED Blood , its flaw be must-see fan Amicus anthology , fan other Amicus movie or fan portmanteau horror movie . my summary provide movie enough appeal your eye , check out . will enjoy !
unique film ... one good time . Acting , script , Quincy Jones ' score , cinematography , edit , etc. -- just fantastic . most viewer know , movie be base Truman Capote 's book famous murder Kansas farm family ( clutter ) couple young guy misguided robbery . have never see movie so brilliantly turn true story riveting film.The actor be solid board , but focus be killer , Dick and Perry , and law enforcement team pursue . Scott Wilson , Dick Hickock be amazing . cocky , twitchy , and devoid compassion come so charming , oily and plausible . Robert Blake Perry Smith be extraordinary as well -- lonely , and once empathetic and cold-blooded . who could fold characteristic one individual and make buy ? do , and be brilliant ! key point book be how take intersection two very differently sociopathic individual create critical mass commit such stupid and heinous crime , and two actor make work beautifully . have moment their subsequent career , but performance be high water mark , and stand act period.The cop be wonderful too . lead investigation be John Forsythe , but other three detective be great well . contemporary movie where producer feel necessary endow police superhuman asset or foible , be just genuine flatfeet , work case determination and competence . seem so real . have never see cop screen so powerful their authenticity ; and have see most crime classic go way back . really one kind respect.PARTIAL spoiler COMING ( movie be unique that already know what be happen , but be warn record).Of course , good scene good crime show and movie be interrogation -- intellectual fencing match cop and crook , Mano Mano . movie have hand good interrogation scene will ever see film . watch Dick and Perry try bluff their way through and slowly unravel , unaware cop have good . but cop need deftly prep their suspect fracture their alibi and hopefully elicit confession . be good act will ever see . think Glengarry Glen Ross showboating.To help translate sad and horrific angle true story , ICB be film actual Clutter house , and have hear clutter be play film student give genuine feel . work . seem decent , simple folk . make crime palpable and sad.I will stop here . be notfeel-good movie , but be one good movie ever make , and so unique , be mandatory viewing film buff .
really like Summerslam due look arena , curtain and just look overall be interesting reason . anyways , could have be one good Summerslam be ever WWF do n't have Lex Luger main event Yokozuna , now be time be ok have huge fat man vs strong man but be glad time have change . be terrible main event just match Luger be be terrible . other match card be Razor Ramon vs Ted Dibiase , Steiner Brothers vs Heavenly Bodies , Shawn Michaels vs Curt Hening , be event where Shawn name his big monster body guard Diesel , IRS vs @card@ Kid , Bret Hart first take Doink then take Jerry Lawler and stuff Harts and Lawler be always very interesting , then Ludvig Borga destroy Marty Jannetty , Undertaker take Giant Gonzalez terrible match , Smoking Gunns and Tatanka take Bam Bam Bigelow and Headshrinkers , and Yokozuna defend world title Lex Luger match be boring and have terrible ending . however deserve positive
always have bit distrust watch British period film usually find insipid and boring screenplay ( such one , example , Vanity Fair or other Boleyn Girl ) , but magnificent production design , European landscape and thick British accent which make movie suggest artistic value which do notreally have.Fortunately , excellent film Young Victoria do notfall situation , and deserve enthusiastic recommendation its fascinating story , excellent performance Emily Blunt , Paul Bettany and Jim Broadbent , and costume and location which unexpectedly make movie pretty rich view.And say " unexpectedly " usually do notpay too much attention details."Victorian era " be ( my humble opinion ) one key point contemporary civilization , and notonly social aspect , but also scientific , artistic and cultural ones.But honestly do notknow origin era very much , and maybe because enjoy simplification political and economic event which prepare landing modern era much.I also like way which Queen Victoria be portray , which be as young and intelligent monarch whose decision be notalways good , but be least inspire good intentions.I also find depiction romance Victoria and Prince Albert very interesting be equally interested combination intellect well as emotion evokes.The only fail find movie be screenwriter Julian Fellowes use clichs romantic cinema love story , something which feel bit out place his screenplay.I like Young Victoria very much , and really take very nice surprise it.I hope more period film follow example movie : costume and landscape should work support interesting story , and notreplacement .
two star be only iconic heroes/villains i know get good TV series , so let 's compare.Freddy - 7 movie Robocop - 3 moviesFreddy - 1 TV series , 2 season , about 40 episode Robocop - 1 TV series , 1 season , about 22-23 episodesFreddy - 2 extra film ( Freddy V Jason , Freddy V Ghostbusters ) Robocop - 4 extra film ( Robocop : Prime Directives : Dark Justice , Meltdown , Crach & Burn , Resurrection)Freddy - 1 upcoming film Robocop - 1 upcoming filmWho 's have more screen time ? well have have 7 movie , 1 TV series , and 1 upcoming film . but Freddy win thank his 2 extra film ( one be fan film ) & 17-18 TV episodes.Since be comment series , Freddy 's Nightmares - ANOES : Series & Robocop : series would personally choose Robocop ...
actually movie be notbad . contain action , comedy and excitement . there be good actor film , instance Doug Hutchison ( Percy " Green Mile " ) , who play Bristol . well know actor be Jamie Kennedy , " Scream " and " Three Kings " . main character be play Jamie Foxx Alvin , who be pretty good and also funny , but one who most surprise , be David Morse Edgar Clenteen . play different character usually do , other film " Green Mile " , " Indian Runner " , " negotiator " or " Langoliers " play very sympathetic person , and " Bait " play almost opposite , man emotion , which be nice see . only really negative thing film , be several picture World Trade Center , which make film perhaps look little date . overall think be pretty good little film !
perfect space fantasy film . group kid go up accidentally space and have get back down , but do , sure do.This would notbe family film all die . then will all be sad . do n't want Kate Capsaw , lead lady give Golden Globe performance , but sadly , nor Lea Thompson win one . suck bad.I ca n't say enough , film be so great , Lea Thompson- o lord , perfect girl film . film be good sure.Sorry , but good Star Wars . Star Wars be so over- rate and space camp be so under- rate . should be other way aroundexcellent positive- 0r maybe 1negative . Iam notgood math

Australian Post Office ever need promotional film recruitment then be it.This be one movie who 's heart be right place and can watch again and again .

movie , be all style , atmosphere , and act . true , do n't believe plot development , but do n't matter- terrific acting , unexpected plot twist , and wonderful atmosphere suck right , and carry along ride , and have great time . Kenneth Branagh be notonly great actor but master accent , and prove once again flawless Georgia accent . be surround so much talent supporting role ( Robert Downey , Jr. , Embeth Davidtz Schindler 's List and Fallen , Tom Berenger , Daryl Hannah , and Robert Duvall ) be simply blow away . recently buy copy movie , and never tire watch . simply one good thriller year . have ignore movie ( and chance be have ) , then suggest check out .
someone who have never be sport , seem would be hard get football ( or as Americans inexplicably call , soccer)-themed " Bend Beckham " . but gotta say , be one cool movie ! Anglo-Indian Jesminder Bhamra ( Parminder Nagra ) and her Wasp friend Juliette Paxton ( Keira Knightley ) love play football ( yes , be go say British - and international - way ) and just adore football player David Beckham . but Jesminder 's traditional Sikh parent do n't approve ( her mother offer really whacked-out description football early movie ) . okay , so maybe be sort clich sense , but gotta love movie ! and , go movie notknow definition " bend " football ... do n't worry , movie explain ( will also never hear David Beckham prior movie ) . and all know Keira Knightley hit big : few month " BILB " come out States , star equally cool " pirate Caribbean : curse Black Pearl " .
First off , must say make mistake watch election film out sequence . say unfortunately , see Election 2 first , Election seem bit disappointment . film be gangster epic that be similar form . and Election be enjoyable piece cinema ... be just notnearly as good be sequel.In first election installment , be show two competitor Chairman ; Big D and Lok . few scene discussion " Uncle 's " who should have Chairman title , ( almost unanimously ) decide Lok ( Simon Yam ) will helm triad . suffice say do n't go over very well competitor Big D ( Tony Leung Ka Fai ) and bid influence takeover , Big D kidnap two uncle order sway election board his side . have disastrous result and head triad all war . Lok be determine become Chairman but wo n't become official can recover " Dragon Head Baton " , material representation Chairman 's power . current Chairman , Whistle ( Chung Wang ) have hide baton somewhere mainland China and race be see who can recover first.Much film be devote recovery Baton . aspiring leader search must dodge cop and opposite side , which lead one stand scene Election , which involve underling name Jet ( Nick Cheung ) , machete , and lot bad guy . Nick Cheung 's presence be attention grab say least ... wonder influence director Johhnie way make second election , do deliver more Jet 's character sequel.While Nick Cheung give scene steal performance , must notfail give due rest film 's actor . election have great ensemble cast well think performance that be both subtle and impact . Simon Yam be his usually glorious self and film also benefit heavyweight HK actor Louis Koo , Tony Leung Ka Fai , and under-appreciated Suet Lam . there really be n't weak link acting and could easily believe be watch real gangsters.Although performance be great , one most impressive thing Election be Johnnie To 's eye camera . there be truly striking shot film and go say To definitely know how frame his shot , viewer be treat series innovative and quite brilliant camera placings and angle . which make election , , great look film.My issue film arise mostly out shear amount character involve Election . get bit hard follow film be so full character that be n't integral plot . sequel opt focus more two candidate , first election offer election process whole ton uncle , underling , and police officer crowd storyline . maybe film would have work good would have be bit longer more time dedicate inner working Triad , or Director Johnnie To would have funnel down necessary element and expound more.Bottom Line- All , be wonderfully brutal film great cast , excellent direction , and leisurely pace pack punch . be just little more complicated need be .

My college professor say Othello may be Shakespeare 's fine drama . do n't know agree yet . buy video version film . first love Kenneth BRanagh Iago , be perfectly complicate and work very well adaptation . surprisingly , do n't direct but play role . Lawrence Fishburne show American actor can play Shakespeare just as well British actor can do . notthere be British vs. American issue . fact , all work together then Shakespeare can reach mass which richly deserve do . apart other Shakespeare tragedy , be deal issue race . something that have exist beginning time . relationship Iago and Emilia could have be good and show complicatedness their union together .

Gregory Peck 's brilliant portrayal Douglas MacArthur Battle Corregidor Philippine start Pacific War largely his removal UN Commander Korean War offer reason believe three above possibility . certainly most controversial American General Second World War ( and possibly ever ) MacArthur be present here man massive contradiction . claim soldier yearn peace , yet obviously glory war ; consistently deny political ambition , yet almost everything do be deliberately use boost presidential candidate ; obviously believe soldier his command have follow his order letter , yet deliberately defy order President United States ; show great respect other culture ( particularly Philippine and Japan ) and yet be completely out touch his own country . all thing be hold balance movie , and end viewer be leave draw his or her own conclusion man , be leave doubt MacArthur sincerely and passionately love his country , and especially army devote his life to.Peck 's performance be , say , brilliant - point , actually , overshadow virtually everyone else film ( which be perhaps appropriate , give who be portray ! ) possible exception Ed Flanders . though offer compelling look Harry Truman and his attitude MacArthur : sarcastic ( repeatedly refer MacArthur " his majesty , " ) angry , frustrated and finally completely feed up General who simply wo n't respect his authority President . Marj Dusay be also intriguing MacArhur 's wife Jean , devote her husband ( whom refer " General , " their relationship seem have be happy enough one . ) very much enjoy movie , perhaps would have like have learn little more MacArthur 's early life . have always chuckle MacArthur 's reaction Eisenhower be elect President ( " will make fine president - be well damn clerk ever have " - which seem sum up what MacArthur think role President should be , especially his military commander wartime . ) well worth watching . positive
be notwell shoot , well write or well act but have be most addictive show have see Twin Peaks . single revelation be time so well have see next episode get kind closure . have even slow down pace show where only reveal tiny amount information episode however feel have just tell everything want know . however acting be just about awful and duologue be downright brutal . character be very two dimensional . more experienced actor Locke and Ecko really stand out actor who play Jack , Kate , Sayid and so . development show can also be very frustrating follow episode may notshow what previous episode lead up . annoy side plot have become part story that sometimes tell nothing . however , second season have develop point where back story reveal more island have previously . all all its great show but notperfect .

well worth watching , especially nice twist journalist integrity , be expect big fall story line Grey Owl be unmask fraud , but be notbe and add generally optimistic and uplift theme and drama story and film.This have be Brosnan 's good performance date , convince admirably English boy play Indians . stand scene be return his ? aunt ? where Brosnan and two elderly lady actress make wonderful scene full feel nostalgia and life lose so little dialogue , just expression and good direction . Perfect.The story be so little know and message universal and all important be real pity film do notget good recognition , maybe time may become bit classic and sleeper . hope so.Well do Dickie Attenborough and cast .

many people movie and many more love , but seem be all wrong reason . Scarface should be like and love but notway have be or is.Many people say act be over-the-top , but who better do over-the-top character Al Pacino . say Pacino go over-the-top here would be understatement . yet do so well , just bring inner devil out so well . his character Tony Montana be notsuch great guy begin but his thirst power just bring his sickness greed level ; inhumane level . sure time Pacino seem be bit cartoonish and surreal but that do notall seem be liability . supporting cast serve its job very well . Michelle Pfeiffer be notreally her good but certainly fit role play . other hand Steven Bauer be his good , still be Steven Bauer . Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio be good and Michelle Pfeiffer fit her role very well . Robert Loggia have always enjoy watch just see yell . other Pacino be notreally standout or memorable performance . everybody just seem fit their role be there . do notfit perfectly but be convince enough.Brian De Palma do very good job direct movie . whenever actor be able become large life his performance credit should be give director and will certainly give De Palma that . Brian De Palma , though notgive respect , be very versatile director my count . know how direct movie accord their genre , but time have notturn out well . here do , be count gangster movie but few be much well one De Palma.The writing be great be just pure Oliver Stone . when see credit end movie and see Oliver Stone have write be notleast bit surprise . be testament though . have always though great writer and prove once again Scarface . nobody know how write surreal reality movie Oliver Stone.The music be good but notgreat . be certainly notmy favorite Giorgio Moroder . music be little bit too 80s-ish but do n't annoy . cinematography be good , notamazing but really who care movie this.This have probably be one most influential movie past 25 year but as mention be wrong reason . people should realize character Tony Montana be hero , be monster . be notinspiring anyway . be greedy , bloodthirsty , uneducated and self consume . yet be role model many people be way or rebel but probably most be delude gangster . vigilante would be Mother Tereasa next Scarface.The good thing movie though be show Tony Montana ' be notreal problem . or people authority would want shut people down could do but do n't . freaky twisted way be necessity our society . be somebody could blame everything and fall good do . Tony Montana ' world be scapegoat our society . way excuse people . instead be more reminder should n't excuse or allow do bad thing just measure up or think measure up compare good gangster or drug dealer . love movie be more corruption movie , be movie strange way make self reflect .

just kidding.Seeking green pasture form hustle New York City , Jon Voight be young optimist Cowboy ( almost Forest Gump-like ) Joe Buck Texas . do nottake long Big Apple mercilessly swallow and his ambition whole and very soon Joe be target both coldness New Yorkers and con its street-thugs . give his pure heart , take pity one thug , Ratso Rizzo ( Dustin Hoffman ) and late move his wreck apartment and two literally struggle survive.While Midnight Comedy be label drama , be well describe either tragic comedy or comedic tragedy my opinion . be all beautiful film that be stylish capture contemporary hippie-vibe late 1960s its mandatory dizzying Warhol-party cinematography and juxtapose ultra-urban New York City . film cram Cowboy Joe Buck somewhere , thereby emphasize his out-of-place position . feel his struggle fit , but also merely get enough money feed Ratso Rizzo.Midnight Cowboy bring tear my eye be also rich substance and project lot heart . imagine film must have inspire Forest Gump its pure-hearted and out-of-place lead character and , extent , Crocodile Dundee film deal almost exact same kind humour - contrast country-cowboys and slick New York cosmopolitan . very compelling and sensationally creative film highly recommend.8.negative

" Gespenster " ( 2005 ) form , together " Yella " ( 2007 ) , and " Jerichow " ( 2008 ) , Gespenster-trilogy director Christian Petzold , doubtless one creme-De-la-creme German movie director our time.Roughly , " Gespenster " tell story French woman whose daughter have be kidnap 3 year old child mother turn around her head 1 minute Berlin - and have never be see ever . then , mother keep travel Berlin whenever there be possibility and search , aid time-dilated photography , girl age approximately present age her age . hear later movie , mother be already lot time convince have find her daughter Marie . however , time , when meet Nina , everything come quite different.The movie do notbring solution , noteven part-solutions , and insofar , be rather disappointing . be notget equip either order decide mother be really insane or not, her actual daughter be still alive or not. most disappointing be end . what have witness movie , be imposition watcher be let alone auteur leave Nina alone . simple walking away symbolize nothing have change , can be strong effect dramaturgy ( f.ex . " Umberto D. " ) , but " Gespenster " , be displaced.Since critic have be suggest Freudian motive movie , let give my own attempt : why be similar person do notknow , especially notperson similar person know ? be quite insane question , agree , standpoint Aristotelian logic , accord which notion individual hold . individual be such person that do notshare its define characteristic anyone else . so , Aristotelian answer my question be : do notknow their similarity be pure change . everybody who be notinsane , believe . however , what case similar person share other similarity which can hardly be change , e.g. scarf their left ankle or heart-shaped birthmark their right shoulder-blade ? be metaphysical context out which movie be make , be notsure even director have realize . our modern , Aristotelian world , superstition , conserve mythology people globe similar people also share part their individuality , and individuality , therefore , be notsomething erratic , but rather diffusional , so border person be open , such and similar believe build strong backbone irrational-ism our otherwise strongly rational thinking - source Gespenster most interesting kind .

 Horror omnibus film be popular seventy . be notvery fond , but one be undeniably excellent slice British horror cinema . House Dripped Blood be horror omnibus , feature four story that surround creepy old house country and be be tell Scotland Yard officer estate agent.This film be headline three well know star horror cinema ; Peter Cushing , Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pitt , whom horror fan will recognise one Lee 's co-star great British horror film time ; Wicker Man.The first segment film , title " Method Murder " tell story horror storywriter , whose creation ; strangler name " Dominic " be bring life his own imagination . story build suspense very well ; his girlfriend , , and audience be lead believe what be see be figment his imagination . story certainly be n't very original , but make up its lack originality atmosphere create and be final twist ; which work incredibly well and come genuine surprise.The second story , title " Waxworks " , star Peter Cushing and be my least favourite four . tale follow story Phillip Grayson ( Cushing ) , man that discover wax museum and decide venture . inside , discover woman that be familiar and who later find out be murderess . quite what woman 's relationship Phillip entail be never really explain , but tale rely more mystery build suspense rather plot detail . Cushing be later join his friend , Neville Rogers ( play Joss Ackland ) and be when tale really start pick up . setting waxwork museum full murderer horror film be n't new idea ; same setting be use great effect excellent 1966 horror film , " Chamber Horrors " . one here be n't as grand one aforementioned film , power setting be use lesser horrify effect , much which be achieve feeling claustrophobia , bring about limited area museum . Peter Cushing be always interesting watch , and see avoid axe-wielding madman be treat horror fan . be my least favourite , story be still entertaining and interesting enough notlet anthology down.The film continue " Sweets Sweet " , which be doubt good omnibus . story star legendary Christopher Lee seemingly overprotective father . beauty story come way be play out . leave audience guess ; know there be something wrong either father or daughter , but do n't know who , or what , be . Christopher Lee , usual , portray his character great degree sinisterness ; audience be leave simmer over his action regard give his daughter doll , and fact be n't allow go school or have toy . card exactly why be hold close chest right end , epitomise truly chilling line which Lee tell his babysitter be , fact , afraid his daughter . ending section be superbly play out , my opinion be one fine ending horror story ever tell , and will stay long end credit roll.The omnibus finish " Cloak " , which be definitely most comedic four . tale be about hammy horror film star , unimpressed his late film 's technical side , go out and buy cloak . naturally , cloak turn out be real vampire cloak . other three tale , one seem be play out mostly laugh . be bad thing however majority humour be funny and serve nice contrast rest film . ending tale coincide nicely ending wraparound story film , which be very sinister yet humorous end very good film . also , look out little jibe regard Christopher Lee Dracula . nice touch , think.Overall , want horror omnibus , really cant go wrong house Dripped Blood . third tale alone make film worthy your time and be very solid horror film indeed .

Vanguard project be early Nasa team which be what soon become Goddard Space flight center.The army rush Jupiter-C , which be essentially US make V2 technology , but work launch satellite response Russia 's success Sputnik.This error may have actually be make Homer , notoriety Von Braun , but his team do n't have their attempt fail . fact underlie Redstone be fly 52 and be first US man rate booster , use Shepard 's sub orbital flight , as well Grissom's.This be why sort movie be so good , hopefully will inspire people read up and spot bit trivia , and process see what have be do , and be inspire do more .
sit part Che last night , back back brief bathroom break , and ca n't recall when 4 hour last pass so quickly . have have psyche up week advance have real ' thing ' director , producer and editor who keep put blow , long quasi epic front and feel whole , 2 2.5 hour be about right movie . so 4 hour seem be stretch limit my tolerance and be very dubious whole enterprise . but will say upfront be beautifully might say lovingly make movie and be really glad see . Director Steven Soderbergh be be congratulate clarity his vision . battle scene zing as be dodge bullet yourself.If there be person planet who do n't know , Ernesto ' Che ' Guevara be Argentinian doctor who help Fidel Castro overthrow Fulgencio Batista 1959 Cuban revolution . when be kid 1960s , Che 's image be everywhere ; bedroom wall poster , T shirt , magazine cover . Che 's image have be one most over exploit ever . famous image be be rely on , then Che be very good look guy , epitome revolutionary romanticism . have be butt ugly , have wonder would have ever be quite so popular public imagination ? course die young helps.Movies have be make Che ( notably excellent Motorcycle Diaries 2004 which star unbearably cute Gael Garcia Bernal young Che , tour South America and see endemic poverty which form his Marxist politics ) but do n't think anyone have ever tackle entire story begin end , and two-parter be ambitious project . hope pay off Soderbergh but can only imagine instant commercial success may nothave be uppermost his mind.The first movie ( Agentine ) show Che meeting Castro Mexico and follow their journey Cuba start revolution and then journey New York 1964 address UN . cleverly shoot black and white image look contemporary film but be n't . second film ( Guerilla ) pick up again 1966 when Che arrive Bolivia start new revolutionary movement . second movie take place almost entirely forest . as far can see be shoot mostly Spain but can still believe must have be quite grueling film . Benicio Del Toro be excellent Che , part seem bear play.Personally , feel Argentine ( ie part one ) be much easy watch and more ' entertain ' strictly movie sense , be upbeat . be win ; revolution will succeed . Che be his element lead disparate band peasant , worker and intellectual revolutionary cause . second part be much hard watch inevitability his defeat . much same way recent Valkyrie - be good movie - be exercise witness heroic failure , so feel same part two Che ( Guerilla ) . know outset die , know fail . be frustrate way story be tell , be obvious fairly early fomentation revolution Bolivia be doom ; Che be regard foreign intruder and fail connect indigenous people way do Cubans . doggedly persist which be frustrate watch feel should have know when give up and move other , perhaps more successful , enterprise . movie do notromanticise too much . kill people , execute , struggle his asthma and follow lose cause long should have give up and move on , leave wife alone bring up five fatherless children.But overall , excellent exercise classic movie making . One note ; watch US trained Bolivian soldier move en masse pick off Che and his small band warrior one one , remind finale Butch Cassidy . almost turn my husband and say so , but hesitate , think would find such thought trite and out place . leave theatre turn and say " do n't think end be Butch Cassidy ! "
think people be estimate incredible film . people be see typical horror movie that be set out scare and prevent get sleep . which be try do then would deservedly get negative but i view film few friend and find very entertaining and though be good movie do have Stephanie Beaton . be reason why i think deserve positive pure entertainment film.The general view movie be have bad acting , simple script 10 year old could produce and cant be take seriously and people be rate low . but i see thoroughly entertaining masterpiece ... that have hilariously funny script which be make even more entertaining actor and notvery serious be very entertaining .
fact movie be predictable be notproblem . movie be beautiful painting be enjoy . museum scene be nice music video . apres sex scene be all too familiar scene our adult life . but movie would nothold interest keith gordon . keith gordon be maybe one most underrate actor our time . almost everything i know act come study mostly his eye . have most compelling face . his character possess quality i look guy , sensitivity and dedication . keith gordon be gorgeous . BTW , i kinda wish will shave his beard now his lip , jawline and adam 's apple be his pretty set next his eye .
watch last night nothave see several year . really be fun little film , bunch face do n't know be . Arkin shine as always . check out ; wo n't be dissappointed . way , be just release DVD and contrary its packaging , be widescreen . transfer be rather poor , but least WHOLE movie be visible . ; - )
" classic be something everybody want have read but nobody want read . classic be also something everyone praise but one have read . " -Mark Twain'Classic ' seem be word use describe " Scarface " , Brian DePalma 's 1983 film opulence , self surrender , greed , and danger Florida 's drug ring . people and critic ( and rapper matter ) deem film ' epic gangster classic ' or ' eptiome gangster film . ' when be anything but . be praise all wrong reason . Scarface be terrific film that deserve praise , but notall praise get audience today , and therefor fine point so poignantly make be miss general public.First off , film be about Cuban refugee , past want escape communism grasp and find happiness . simple ? yes . but layer De Palma 's direct genius , and great story write Oliver Stone ( yes know , actually write real good one here ) play . character be all look escape , escape be natural element deal film . character have something offer , that make likable everyone who could appreciate film . be entwine world mystique and money , but that have price , all learn . character think be get good chance life , when true dramatic irony , be actually get bad . ' Tragedy ' would be good word describe movie . all who praise film 's drug usage , be violence , be dialog , totally miss point . there be nothing really positive film character positive expectation . and be why film work so well . devastation film serve deliver message film , notlook cool or attract viewer . Brian De Palma do n't make movie cult gangster , or brainless action fans.Next , film be adult drama . be not' gangster film ' . have be share action , but action be plot very carefully , so have point . be not" Aliens"- example big dumb action film , and most audience perceive film big dumb action gangster film do drug and shoot people . ridiculous . hogwash . film be about , then be about how bad be . notpromotion it.This be say , film be indeed great film . have great cinematography that pull story . have very dramatic score ( true Giorgio Moroder style ) , which simply could give chill , or bring tear . film be rather lengthy , but be story , and moment count . acting be terrific . Al Pacino - enough say . can do role put his mind , and be exception . pretty boy Steven Bauer , Manny . do n't think much other film do , but actually make like when go maestro De Palma 's direction . Michelle Pfeiffer be true gem Elvira . pop ' fresh heel sort embarrassment " grease 2 " get her ticket ride perform no hold bar performance beauty that be more meet eye . but three true diamond rough be Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio Tony 's sister Gina , who when smile , or cry , see her soul and her fresh way living , and watch deteriorate ; Paul Shenar Alejandro Sosa , drug lord , who run deep river , and Shenar portray as so ; and Miriam Colom Tony and Gina 's torn mother . three dig film deep can go.This reviewer learn one main thing when watch " Scarface " first time . always go film unsuspecting . all hype and talk film can possibly prepare what really see . only know De Palma ( do ) can give even glimpse what film hold . so ignore rap crap , ignore mindless violence supporter , and fix glass Bailey 's rock , and indulge emotional viewing great film , real " Scarface .

discover film read book that inspire . be notstrictly biographical film ; be " loosely base " fact . but find compelling and eerie exploration evil and madness , and Michel Serrault give unforgettable performance Dr. Petiot.There be many memorable image movie ; Petiot travel night vampire , his black cloak flap , be almost iconic . there be also several touch expressionism - Petiot 's crooked silhouette mount stair lead cellar where butcher remains his victim await cremation , remind scene ' Nosferatu'.But I find primary appeal movie be aural . soundtrack be load ominous sound , start foreboding music opening credit , accompany wordless wail . Petiot live and run his medical practice complex many small shop , and there be persistent background noise knife be sharpen somewhere , as well peddler play eerie tune saw . there be animal noise as well - concierge keep goat , unseen cat howl - and later film see hapless cattle be herd underpass . whole atmosphere be unsettling , overtone violence and slaughter.Not only animal , but human voice be often hear - scream Gestapo victim , Petiot 's patient his wait room , monitor listen device , just same suspected collaborator war be monitor their cell . even action film be often arrange so hear voice participant see - when Petiot go see Mme Kern , hear her singing work , her voice echo theater , ever see . and even when do appear , be often film behind , her voice call out her husband , whose voice call out conversation . disembodied voice echo large hall , and their owner , when see , be photograph distance , so can actually see speak . be ghost story , and be voice ghost - many Petiot 's future victims.Yet Petiot be often only voice ; his frightening laughter echo retreat camera , throw comment or air nobody . way , be as much ghost murder . be always frantically busy , scurry appointment appointment , never rest . but his activity be machine - lifeless and imperturbable . be interesting all horror and danger occupied Paris , Petiot alone be unafraid ; be amused , enthusiastic , angry , irritated , contemptuous , but never afraid , real people lure their death . be surprise boast his mechanical invention , include perpetual motion machine ( true detail book - do claim have invent many machine ) ; be sort perpetual motion machine . and mechanical imagery be everywhere film , opening giant wheel movie house , Petiot 's bicycle ( its squeak wheel echo sound sharpen knife ) , Victrola keep wind up play music make kill . even his routine his victim be mechanical - write note your wife , let disguise leave , need vaccination , Barcelona , Casablanca , Dakar - well-oiled machine , routine be always same , just record be always same.Maeder , author , say be clockwork perfection his crime that weigh so heavily Petiot his trial . his system be as smooth and efficient Nazi concentration camp , and may be why movie invent subplot Petiot 's involvement French Gestapo and occupying Nazi . unfortunately , do n't quite work part story , be very hard figure out just what Petiot be do collaborator , or what be go when end up their headquarters middle night . dispose body ? hide stolen good ? be hard say , and hard believe ; be notlikely state would turn freelancer Petiot.But do remind duality evil people ; Petiot be robber and murderer , but be also devoted father and husband . just learn Hitler love dog , and Nazi guilty bad war crime could also be loving father and family man , so have recognize Petiot could commit unspeakable horror and yet also function normally . his insanity be easily camouflage insanity and horror wartime situation Paris ; when kill , rob and disappear be happen all around , nobody pay attention Petiot toss more corpse pile .
many people here , start out find my patience be try film . end , actually shed few tears.It seem be nature most old film drag 7/8th length and then catch fire right end . old film-goers learn bide their time patiently slow part , calm knowledge big payoff be way . but be n't quite accurate . see , early audience , what be " slow part " be main body story . watch and find anecdotal and thematic interest there . modern audience , post-Spielberg , be constant state wait be hit small climax two minute when see old film . be inflation problem modern movie . well , that be n't go happen . be notnecessary apologize film ; be simply have adjust your expectation and personal rhythm when watch . point , difference Avatar and Informer be difference Euripides and travel production Rent . think minute or two . notstrain obvious , but Euripides still deserve hearing.The " exciting part " , most modern viewer , begin IRA tribunal scene and escalate final couple minute , which , be board or even pay attention time , will tear your heart out . be nothigh-tone universal abstract plea forgiveness ; be plea one dimwit , and who feel sorry big lummox , little mercy . be personal , and embarrassingly naked appeal . after be mad Gypo , irritate , think be dumb character time , finally find win over scene Gypo 's erstwhile girlfriend plead woman talk her man go easy him.The film may be sentimental , but sentimentality be notcheap here have charge . there be matter life and death that play out here , and as long take proposition one life customer seriously , be sentimentality wring out most serious stuff.8 10 . and fault notbe 10 10 be my own and measure , be read . have all ask more , ever more , faster , ever faster can put 1935 -- just yesterday , really -- as easily should be able .
not one your harder-hitting story , and be real strength film . there be least two relationship which less confident writer would have add all-too predictable romantic tension . notonly spare audience , but throw surprise same time . there be few Disney-ish moment , particularly end , but be manageable . overall , be worth rental and be good , relax fun.BTW , get DVD , watch segment where director teach how make aloo gobi . follow her direction and be Brilliant ! next time will make day plan eat , be one dish that definitely get good full night fridge let spice out !
film have great acting , great photography and very strong story line that really make think about who be , how define , how fit , accept play role or break free ... there already be excellent comment deal aspect . want comment formal setting film . basically , be two people roof . there be unity place and time , 2 protagonist , and radio act choir . many director have turn Greek tragedy film , many director have film contemporary story as be Greek tragedy , but director , my opinion , have succeed as admirably Ettore Scola approach purity and force great Greek tragedy both story line and formal setting . masterpiece .
I Ghost story . good ghost story bump night , voice that can be explain . now have see many . special efx have ever more grip today film , time find real gem , gotta turn clock back time when writer and director really have use their head create really good ghost story . now one , very rare , pilot episode TV series Ghost Story call " New House " be one most scary film ever see . be on once 1972 , ... be only 9,..but nothing then even compare . all remake go Hollywood , one should do one " as be " more special efx original . episode be down right creepy hell . be lucky find finally DVD today and very rare and hard find . only other 2 Ghost Stories even come close be ORIGINAL " Haunting " and George C. Scott " Changling " . wish someone would do more ghost story .

 Enormous fun adult and child , film work numerous level : there be everything car crash and cake face very good ( yet subtle ) joke adults.Glenn Close be her sublimely evil good Cruella ( ` call Ella ' ) De Ville.After three year Dr. Pavlov 's Behaviour Modification Clinic be cure her desire fur even puppy-skin fur have so intensely desire . even have her fur coat place dungeon extraordinary castle inhabits.But would n't be Dalmatian ' movie subterfuge and machination Cruella and know something will change her behaviour modification . and now need one extra puppy ( hence 102 Dalmatians ) complete her nefarious scheme time round.Ioan Gruffudd be instantly appeal hero film that run ` Second Chance ' dog shelter . be ` Titanic ' and last year 's television version ( Pip ) ` great expectation ' do n't recognize ; well , be Fifth Officer Lowe ' ` Titanic ' and do n't see ` great expectation ' be notterribly surprised.Gerard Depardieu do delightful turn furrier-pawn Cruella . prance and posture most outlandish and outrageous fur clothing have ever see and do well . his ' Wicked Witch West ' homage be hilarious.Tim McInnerny be superb be Cruella 's not-so-evil henchman be also Alonzo , ' Cruella 's butler , ` 101 Dalmatians ' and may also recognize ` Black Adder ' Brit-Coms . play his usual bumble , good-hearted , somewhat dim-witted character great effect.Oscars costume be generally give entirety costume film . be unfortunate clothing wear Glenn Close be amazing be incredibly detailed ( note handcuff when be be release behaviour Modification Clinic ) and worthy such over-the-top character . her clothing alone deserve least Oscar nomination.Animation hold special place my heart but compare film original animated film be compare apple orangutan : ca n't be do . suffice say ` 102 Dalmatians ' be even good film version ` 101 Dalmatians ' that come out 1996 . there be lot like here : sight gag , dialogue , and costume casting - be good film whole family .
happen like Leslie Howard , his good film . yet , reason , his performance Human BONDAGE never have move tremendously . first see film my college campus 1972 and reviewer college newspaper make comment 1930s and 1940s Howard play role supposedly later pick up Dirk Bogard man who be bear be betray . be notusually case ( hand think Ashley Wilkes man who might be betray , and Scarlett O'Hara be mean be item Margaret Mitchell - but Ashley love Melonie , notScarlett ) . Howard could play type , and role R. J. Mitchell or Professor Henry Higgins be notone who be betrayed.*(*One can make case Philip Armstrong Scott be betray two stranger show hospitality 49TH Parallel , but be Nazi who consider - liberal , westerner , Canadian - fair game double cross wartime . be n't same emotional betrayal , and Howard do notshrivel up result , but face Nazis and capture one beat up.)I think what reviewer mean be Howard could be soulful - or try be soulful . witness his poet - dreamer - wanderer PETRIFIED Forrest . but character be notbetray , history perhaps ( feel his type be as out date gangster play Humphrey Bogart ) . character Philip Carey Somerset Maugham 's Human BONDAGE be soulful too . be sensitive several reason . have interest art and try become painter - but artist Strickland Moon and SIXPENCE have real talent . so decide concentrate medical study , accentuate club foot condition have . here be man low self-esteem who be set up be betrayed.Philip find betrayal form Mildred Cockney waitress ( Bette Davis ) who be mercenary and as selfish come . why Philip fall be notreally address film , but do find woman fascinating . and find easy meal ticket . ironically be so captivate slut , Philip fail notice two other woman who be interested ( Kay Johnson and Frances Dee ) , and be more fit be his mate . also keep find forgiving Davis when have affair other man ( Alan Hale and Reginald Denny - latter friend Howard's).Although Howard 's performance capture doormat tendency Philip Mildred , really do notshow enough passion ( late movie , when turn her ) . be why find never care his performance here - lack reality . his later tortured insistence GONE WITH wind love Olivia De Haviland , notVivian Leigh , have more consistency man love . but performance Davis Mildred make film important . have wide variety part up 1934 , girlfriend deaf pianist man who PLAYED God or spoiled heiress who get murder FOG Over Frisco or mouse-like secretary Three ON A MATCH . Mildred finally show could be major actress play selfish bitch.Curiously her performance be notall one note . use and abuse Howard two third film , culminate famous scene where show how disgusted his kissing make , her last scene show too could fall apart due her health deteriorate , and her inability keep honest job . when Howard reject viewer fail note how equally vicious become ( ask what happen her baby - tell baby die and Howard say brusquely be glad , which be hardly response expect ) . end Howard do finally get his life order , but Mildred end casualty ( ironically her death discover her old boyfriend Denny medical call ) . Motion Picture Academy Art and Sciences do fail nominate Davis 1934 ( lead large write - campaign 's history , and permanent change be rule ) , but Davis be establish star . one year win Oscar Joyce Heth DANGEROUS . and two year co-star Howard again ( equal star ) PETRIFIED Forrest .

there seem be only two type review film net . who hate and curse Ralph Bakshis name and love and call work genious . be incline be middle . I'am force agree most criticism film ( e.g.the cruel cutting story , badly rotoscoped charecters , act etc ... ) but dispite still love film . rotoscoping ( when do properly)adds eerie lifelike dimension charecters and final battle scene end film be fantastic . surrealistic scene when nineriders chase Frodo be stylish and well execute and musical score ... magic . sadly bad point outweight film but can bring ignore be great film.(No doubt will be lynch angry mob people who hate film write review , ah well , such be life )

 Intelligent , wry , and thrilling , " Invisible Man " stand out 2000 Sci-Fi 's usual lineup , balance " Farscape" 's fantastical art direction and sometimes melodramatic script gritty , cynical plot and modern noir dialogue . show sit " Law and Order " and " Doctor who " believability meter , but there be no deny fact " I-Man" 's character go caricature . even character that verge predictability Keeper , Official , and Eberts be give reprieve formulaic . Paul Ben-Victor and Vincent Ventresca have chemistry that evolve and shift elegantly , make even more remarkable revolving door team writer and director . effect be never allow overwhelm plot , and science only sometimes verge totally unbelievable . show 's low point be still entertaining , and have never see such taut pilot episode . Matt Greenberg and Sci-Fi should be commend , and fan have right demand comprehensive DVD edition show . time come marathon " Hercules : Legendary Journeys " Sci-Fi , roll my eye and sigh , mourn excitement and possibility science fiction television " Invisible Man " and its ilk represent .

do notknow time my youth that could general be know film however way make film be notwhat fact draw my attention , what make motion picture most like film even very day have ever see be Heroism,bravery and Honor have serve her Majestys Service.This film be notalways what seem and that be perhaps should be,however cant say enough courage exhibit Sgt.Cutter defense uniform too would sacrifice his life save peril sort and troop be threaten emergence thugee group.To be certain Sgt. Cutter be kind individual might suggest something about and then watch unequivocal belief notonly other but her majesty Queen England.I think his lust money and such character be great.A reckless brave courageous soldier who do notknow fear.I think Grant be excellent role,truly very capable rendering make compelling uniform wore.I never feel Ballantine be shoe-in ,in fact there be so much confidence there assumption might be well notlook close be still only picture.What do mean ? picture be still only motion picture and time which event take place well as when picture be actually make provide look how thing be do then and what or why there be so many different opinion as motion picture will distract your attention.Both Ballantine and MaChesney be equal there dedication man time time provide unflinching daring as there job man service her Majesty.These three seem bring thing off rather well and believe be useful,even enjoyable interlude when Ballantine have date destiny or so would seem only have fate would have intervene.Is believable ? do n't know.I think be very fitting when company have escape clutch death Tantrapur and be drag there tail be approach main gate Regiments Post when Ballantine allow other two know be leave service,and get married and go tea business.MaChesney say could sign up 9 years.It will make man out him.I that sentiment.I do n't think there be doubt as just what mean have brave dependable courageous soldier represent your very good interests.Where do end,in fact may never end.Those interest be so well place what be important world enjoy picture today as much perhaps enjoy picture when be ten year old.I have never know truthfulness film up recently when go history and find information Kali.There be quite good deal learn however once all be say and do historical significance Goddess Kali,this motion picture take quality refer intelligence.This be very honest attempt convey belief what be be attempted.I think be excellent film.George Stevens directed.There be few item be aware do n't think all information will jive history however when journalist be address Mr.Kipling thing can get very emotional all rest be character but be Rudyard Kipling ? George Stevens go top convey time and time when event actually occurred.The information be honest,compelling and will notonly draw in but will need understand about why so love Gunga Din.There be distance Black Watch be out front and be approach most certain peril and possible defeat troop can be warned.Sgt.Cutter be seriously wound and Ballantine as well MaChesney be restrained.Din have deep wound base his back result bayonet thrust deeply his body behind be up demand have warn Colonel impending peril.With effort worthy our most sincere desire life time Din slowly climb and manage scale steeple which rest top tuggee temple.The sound Gunga Dins horn allow approach army be forewarned.A very large scale battle ensue and enemy be nullified.It be so dramatic and tense fill position Gunga Din lie Dead pile rock which his bullet riddle body now shows,Sgt.Cutter say good work soldier.I do n't know more dramatic moment nor one where learn what sacrifice mean then when troop be forewarn impending peril.The end be far be anti-climatic,it be tell who Gunga Din be and what mean now honor man uniform whom willing sacrificed.Ballantine know his heart and ask Colonel take care his enlistment paper and make MaChesney quite please Colonel being honest place enlistment paper his pocket be deal perhaps more appropriate time.The Colonel say place where now be gather have all do enough soldier one long day and further comment how pleased there effort be defense.MaChesney say would rather here colonel get bloomin medal.This be very sober point and then come Din.Now here be man who have actually status be go appoint corporal and his name shall be write roll our honor dead.The poem be read as be just pen Kipling who stand gravesite colonel and rest men.Gunga Din Bravo !

No sense go story enough reviewer have do that . here be few different slant one " religious nut , " one bigoted reviewer put so tolerantly.1 ) " Baby Face " ( 1933 ) offer perhaps classic example ever put film how woman can manipulate man sex . there be lot truth what Barbara Stanwyck demonstrate film : look cute , bat your eyelash , offer your body free ... ..and man will fall help out whatever want.In case , be job advancement ultimate goal money ... ..lots . least four man film do provide just that , even ruin their life process.2 ) ending - which many reviewer here seem hate - give great message : all money and material good world wo n't make person feel fulfill . sad comment so many " critic " here would rather have immoral message , prefer sleaze substance . surprise , guess.Any way look , movie be entertain start-to-finish and Stanwyck have great line , particularly beginning when tell off her crude father and his unruly bar customer . little 70 minute , film move fast pace and be over know .
Red Eye be good little thriller watch Saturday night . intense acting , great villain and unexpected action.Some might notwant see movie go very short 85 Min 's and 88 % movie be plane and just talk . do n't worry pull off very well smart and witty dialog.A PG-13 movie seem be new ground director Wes Craven . but surely enough have fit much violence possibly can thriller.This movie strong point be its cast . film need good actor deliver dialog and thrill . do n't have actor film would have be lose and boring . have Rachel McAdams Mean Girls and Wedding Crashers .

love MIDNIGHT Cowboy and have my video collection be favorite mine . what be interesting be how when MIDNIGHT Cowboy come out 1969 , be so shocking viewer be rate X. course , time X mean Maturity . be only two year old time movie 's release , be hard imagine just how shocked viewer be back then . however , when try take account many topic cover film , which include prostitution ( title be slang male prostitute ) ; homosexuality ; loneliness ; physical ( and extent emotional well ) abuse and drug be hard many people talk about day , can begin get sense what viewer movie think back its release . be worth note 1970 be , MIDNIGHT Cowboy be downgrade R rating and even be still rate R , scene could almost be rate PG-13 today 's standards.I want briefly give synopsis plot be probably know almost anyone who have hear movie . Jon Voight play young man name Joe Buck Texas who decide can make big male hustler New York City escort rich woman . emulate cowboy actor Roy Rogers wear cowboy outfit think that will impress woman . be reject all woman have come across , meet sleazy con-man name Enrico " Ratso " Rizzo who be play Dustin Hoffman . Ratso convince Joe can make kind money have manager . once again , Joe be con and before long be homeless . however , Joe come Ratso and be invite stay dilapidated apartment . give away much more plot , want say remainder movie deal Joe and Ratso try help one attempt fulfill their dream . i.e. Joe make gigolo and Ratso go down Florida where think can regain his health.I want make comment movie . first , acting be excellent , especially lead . movie be really very sad beginning end , there be classic scene . fact , there be scene be notintend be funny , find amusing . example , there be classic scene where Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight be walk down city street and cab practically run over . Dustin Hoffman bang cab and say " Hey , be walkin ' here ! be walkin ' here ! " get kick out scene be so typical New York City where so many people be hurry . scene that come mind be scene where Ratso ( Dustin Hoffman ) send Joe ( Jon Voight ) guy name O'Daniel . what be amusing be first , think O'Daniel be there recruit gigolo and can see why Joe be get so excited but then begin realize O'Daniel be nothing but religious nut . addition two scene mention , love scene where Ratso and Joe be argue their apartment when Ratso say Joe his cowboy outfit only attract homosexual and Joe say self-defense " John Wayne ! gonna tell be fag ! " what like be delivery that scene.I would say even MIDNIGHT Cowboy be set late ' 60 be , much ring true today . be area 42nd Street New York have be clean up form Disneyfication last several year , homelessness be still just as prevalent there now be 40 year ago . also , many people have unrealistic dream how be go strike big only have their dream smash be case Jon Voight character . One thing that impress Jon Voight 's character be how be survivor and feel end movie , have mature great deal and Ratso ( Dustin Hoffman 's character ) be good influence him.In conclusion , want say suggest when watch movie , should watch least couple time there be so many thing that go on . example , there be bunch flashback and dream sequence that make more sense couple viewing . also , what find interesting be there be lot movie that be leave interpretation such what really happen Joe Buck ( Jon Voight 's character ) and people who be his life Texas . even ending , do n't want give away who have notsee movie , be rather open-ended .
Cecil B.

 Obsession come many flavor , and exist variety reason ; may be nothing more compulsive disorder , but other may be avenue survival . lack nurture , combine inability negotiate even simple necessity daily life or basic social requirement , may compel even genius enthusiastically embrace which provide personal comfort zone . and extreme case , object satisfaction may become manifest obsession , drive individual what begin means survival become very impetus his undoing , and as discover ` Luzhin Defence , ' direct Marleen Gorris , high level intelligence will notinsure satisfactory resolution problem , and fact , may actually exacerbate situation . obsession , seem , have prejudice or preference ; moreover , give quarter.At Italian resort 1920 be , Alexander Luzhin ( John Turturro ) be one who have gather there chess tournament , winner which will be World Champion . Luzhin be Master game , but be vulnerable chess have long since cease be game ; rather , be his obsession , one thing discover childhood that see his total ineptness seemingly area life , and enable cope subtle disenfranchisement his immediate family . so Luzhin be genius Achilles heel , flaw which perhaps only one other person know about and understand , and furthermore realize can be exploit his own personal gain very tournament . man be Valentinov ( Stuart Wilson ) , Luzhin 's former mentor , who absence year have suddenly reappear and make known Luzhin.Valentinov be unwelcomed , disconcert presence Luzhin , and once again life threaten overwhelm . notonly be about face formidable opponent tournament , Turati ( Fabio Sartor ) , whom previous match emerge draw fourteen hour , but be also attempt resolve new element his life -- his feeling young woman be just meet resort , Natalia ( Emily Watson ) . and , genius may be , dark cloud be gather that just may push Luzhin even deep obsession that have be save grace , well curse , his entire life.To tell Luzhin 's story , Gorris effectively use flashback gradually reveal element his childhood very quickly lead his obsession chess . and his background be establish , afford insight that allow audience more fully understand who Luzhin be and how get point his life . scene his childhood , Gorris texture appropriately dark atmosphere and subtle sense foreboding that carry , and underlie , present , more pastoral setting resort . transition which weave past together present be nicely handle , and pace Gorris set make riveting , yet unrushed presentation that work extremely well . also underplay menace produce presence Valentinov , concentrate drama rather suspense , which ultimately serve heighten overall impact film , make Luzhin 's tragedy all more believable and unsettling.The single element that make film so memorable , however , be affect performance John Turturro . film work , Luzhin must be absolutely believable ; one false or feign moment would be disastrous , would take viewer out story immediately . do n't happen , however , and film do work , Luzhin Turturro create be impeccably honest and true-to-life . capture Luzhin 's genius , as well his inadequacy , and present his character term that be exceptionally tell and very real . be performance equal , notsurpass , Geoffrey Rush 's portrayal David Helfgott ` Shine .

Doctor Mordrid be one rare film that be completely radar , but be totally worthwhile . really remind old serial 30s and 40s . which be why will have love see follow-up movie ... but judge rest Full Moon 's output there simply be n't enough tit satisfy typical audience . unfortunately , thanks completely superfluous sacrifice scene there two too many family audience - which be unfortunate , em ' this could have be Harry Potter-style magicfest kid would have eat up .

 Watching John Cassavetes film , Opening Night , be remind something Quentin Tarantino say once interview personal experience be creator art or act . refer example , say , run dog his way act play would n't be end his life but would affect , and , doubt , would have bring experience stage even be light comedy . " otherwise , " say , " what be do ? " could n't help but think his word when watch Gena Rowland 's character , Myrtle Gordon , who almost whole week or so go very similar scenario . there be more Cassavetes ' film , course , be about how theater work star actress , what emotion and human nature mean when look play character , and how live when one have ( Myrtle Gordon ) be theater.Near beginning film , exit performance , Myrtle be sign autograph and one such fan name Nancy come up her favorite star and pour her heart out Myrtle . be touching little moment , but do n't last have get car ( pour rain and all ) . then watch horror girl , who stand right next car drive off , get hit car auto accident . be notsure really what happen , but then find out next day fact girl do die hit . then be sort stun even think be out her system . first show small way , when rehearse scene her fellow actor ( play Cassavetes ) and ca n't seem stand be hit - blame lack depth character ( writer : " what do think play lack ? " " hope , " say Myrtle)- but then Nancy start show up , apparition Myrtle be all real , be suddenly gone.Cassavetes , as past film , be search what mean have emotion , really feel something and feel , or lack thereof , and how affect other person . be n't exactly new ground Rowlands , who previously play woman edge Woman influence ( case alcohol ) , nor would be alien territory costar Ben Gazzara , who just come off star Killing Chinese Bookie . but actor express everything essential their character scene ; Cassavetes do n't tell how get A B scene , and do n't need . there be mood Cassavetes film that trump sometimes grungy camera-work . know Myrtle , example , should be content somehow , even be n't plot . but be haunt , and be unsatisfied her character 's lack depth and tone play ( " Aging , who go see ? " ask playwright ) , and start affect her too.The question soon become though notwhat be usual . conventional dramatist would make conflict ' will be able go stage , will show go on ? ' be n't important Cassavetes , even be there , be question ' will be alright ? ' perhaps go such grueling play " Second Woman " could help her work her personal demon and her lose her grip reality ( see Sara and attack front total stranger , who wonder what hell be go ) ? or will play 's lack hope strain everything else wrong ? depth Rowlands make her character be intense and harrow , and be expect do n't mean be any dull Woman Influence- anything , be just as good film be honest person profession , and consequently other performance be just as true , Gazarra Nancy play subtle Laura Johnson . Cassavetes answer his own pose question be n't easy.One real thrill Opening Night , along see great actor perform amazing script , be see Cassavetes take theater way do . see play performed- and be apparently real play- and only know slightly what be about . when see actor stage perform , wax and wane be involve what melodrama be go ( relationship scuffle and affair and occasional slap and domestic violence ) and improvisation actor . wonder watch how much really be improvise , how much Cassavetes allow other actor do scene where Myrtle start go loopy or , climax , be completely smash . be stage , too , so must have be something work out beforehand and let what would happen happen.It be funny , startling , chilling , and edge-of-your-seat stuff , good theater-on-film scene ever put movie , and see line actor stage , actor film , actor actor , blur together wonderfully . open Night be potent drama that be full frank talk death and madness , reality and fiction , where love be people , and really , finally , what do ' acting ' mean ?

Hoffman may have beg change street , but " user " point-out Jon Voight be notmajor star film " Midnight Cowboy " - his actual salary would surprise . think be rob ! one can doubt clarity put his role , nor made star such great work " Deliverance " . define potent man who have conquer his devil and be good : few people comment have be sodomized movie . end 60s may have be one first film be so open , but society have always be hip.I also do notfind homosexuality " Ratzo " and " Joe " - be clearly opposite , unappealing one . find much purely high relationship - true friendship . do n't understand end movie , then have waste your time . " Joe 's " bewilderment , but unashamed devotion be apparent . yes , Voight deserve Oscar role - one that John Wayne could never pull-off , and be as handsome his youth.Hoffman be Hoffman - expect firework . give superbly .

" Joe " pointedly name his purpose - situation , will have handed-over money quicker ask . be one scene that make movie break-through , one which do notwatch . get heartbroken ... ..John Schlesinger certainly must have be familiar sordidness direct chillingly beautiful eye-opener- Waldo Salt do n't write clairvoyance . anyone who have part get screen must have realize be make history , and should be proud honesty . perhaps " only America " can close our eye unpleasant situation , other movie-makers make compunction present public . notlook doe n't mean be n't there - give truth time . Bravo ! ... ...

Dance , Fools , Dance -- one *four* film Harry Beaumont direct 1931 -- be barely 80 minute long , yet its character be well develop , its story never seem rush , and its many twist plot , audience be never leave behind.With lone exception Lester Vail flaccid love interest Bob Townsend , support cast be uniformly strong . worthy note be William Bakewell Crawford 's brother , Cliff Edwards ( good know voice Jiminy Cricket ) reporter Bert Scranton , and Clark Gable early support role gangster Jake Luva.But be Joan Crawford 's film , and absolutely shine . make when be just 27 , lesser-known version Crawford will probably be unrecognizable more familiar her late work . however , here be proof long take home Oscar Mildred Pierce , Crawford be star true sense word , terrific actress charisma carry picture all herself.Score : EIGHT out TEN
there be old saying that relate rousing new film Joe Johnston that go something : " man who think can and man who think ca n't be right . " be highly presumptuous statement refer self motivate and belief individual , which , movie , stand true even road block and family trouble stand way."October sky " be about young man who believe name Homer Hickam , grow up strict , traditional family 1950 's . homer love small coal mining town where nearly man grow up be miner . his friend , Quentin , Roy , and O'dell all think their life high school will be everyone else be . homer be notexit future.One night , everyone stare sky , Russian space craft call Sputnik pass overhead . be something new Homer , and find spectacular and overwhelming . point , his look life will never be same.First , tell everyone want work rocket scientist area occupation . flabbergast what say , his family pass idea their head and continue life usual his friend , however , think idea may have potential . , Quentin be very smart individual when come kind thing.When four friend start test model rocket , and blow white picket fence smithereens , then what seem be forest fire be scare , be force end their progresses.The performance movie be absolutely riveting start finish . actor give performance be real mumbo jumbo here . stand out glory : Laura Dern Miss Riley . very well may be Academy award material judge can remember back beginning year when film be released.The character be also extremely well develop . notonly filmmaker give clear , apparent reason why Homer be interested subject , but also explain audience how be succeed their studding rocketry . clearly understand character ' motive and belief , especially father , who be bend over everlasting tradition.The film , unfortunately , lose its momentum mid-point silly , recycled romantic sub-plot involve Homer 's love interest and how his brother steal . type be become so awfully common high-school movie , notfilm be aim high-schoolers . actor stare other mindlessly , be trance . put up complain 1997 's " Inventing Abbots , " but have have just about enough this.But that be just minor complaint . authentic look time period , cinematography Oscar and clip real life Homer and friend end , whom all hit big their dream , especially Homer , be first great film 1999 .

sit down watch " Midnight Cowboy " thinking would be overrate ' 60s/'70s movie . my favorite film come ' 70s , same vein " Midnight Cowboy " ( " taxi Driver , " " Mean Street , " " panic Needle Park , " etc. ) but there be many , many overrate one well that have gain strong reputation critic be groundbreaking - unfortunately vast majority do n't hold up well today . sort feel way " Easy Rider . " ( , too , be one my favorites.)So , do n't expect much " Midnight Cowboy " but get lot back . be touching story , well-made and well-told good performance time . Dustin Hoffman , Enrico " Ratso " Rizzo , give one his good - be bit funny time ( sound cartoon character when speak - maybe Lenny/"Simpsons " connection ) , but Hoffman be entirely convincing . half film 's budget go his paycheck be just become major star Hollywood . be second-billed Jon Voight Joe Buck , " cowboy " who travel North Big Apple hope become male prostitute . soon his naive way land trouble and pair up crippled scam artist name " Ratso " - who offer become Joe 's " manager " certain percentage profits.The movie be quite long two hour but never really seem very long . film can tend drag , especially film that be make ' 70s ( have be say " Easy Riders , Raging Bulls " ) director be star movie 1970s and occasionally get bit too infatuated their material , go too long examine characters/scenes/etc . that be n't important . just only scene feel be bit too long and unnecessary be drug party - make film seem extremely outdated ( similar drug odyssey " Easy Rider " ) and really harm its flow be notneeded.Other , " Midnight Cowboy " be almost flawless motion picture . be pleasantly surprise . do have its flaw ( flashback be bit tacky and never use as well could have be , instance ) and scene be bit uneasy ( such gay movie theater sequence ) but can handle its content " Midnight Cowboy " be truly great motion picture , uncompromising examination life street late ' 60s/early ' 70s . be depressing movie , yes , and today 's standard might seem bit outdated and heavy liberal perspective " life be horrible , etc. " ... but still love and particularly extremely touching ending will stay long , long time.Highly recommend . One good film ' 70s . ( be technically release late 1969 but will still categorize 1970s film . also win Best Picture Oscar , be first - and only - X-rated motion picture do so . be later re-rated R appeal.)4.5/5

basically exact same movie " House Wax " - Vincent Price 's first genuine horror hit release previous year - but seriously who care , " Mad Magician " offer just many sheer thrill , delightful period set-pieces , joyous 3-D effect , sublime acting performance and macabre horror gimmick its predecessor !

Don Gallico be about perform his very first own illusionist show Gallico Great and plan exhibit great magic trick history ; entitle " Girl and Buzz Saw " .

Buchanan hold selfish Poles have n't confront Nazi , draw foolishly meddle Britain and giddily altruistic France , war would have engulf West . believe rigor Total War , no one Germany would have build gas chamber provide final solution Jewish Problem.Some commenter site feel " Watch " sag weight stale propaganda . maybe . however , neither my friend nor Pat Buchanan seem have get film 's point : people hurt and kill grab other people 's land , good , and liberty ; such people dominate Axis Powers and " enough " do n't appear their vocabulary.Paul Lukas deserve Oscar win . and Bette Davis put convincing passion their portrayal refugee who fight oppressor . give emotional punch intellectual case step off sideline , actively face down torturer and murderer . Bernard Dick note Hellman do n't care Lukas person stay apolitical . course , Hungarian have see first-hand Bela Kun 's bloody " dictatorship proletariat " replace outmoded empire and then topple Admiral Horthy 's right-wing tyranny.In marvelous cameo role add play Hammett , Henry Daniell sardonically depict Wehrmacht officer class that disdain brown shirt serve . his Phili von Ramme would doubtless stand Field Marshal Rommel 1944 Plot July 20th Hitler .

A chance encounter salesman and hit-man change both their life . be odd film that work , impressive effort writer-director Shepard . daringly unglamorous role that be far cry James Bond , Brosnan be surprisingly effective lonely hit-man who start buckle stress his job , but be unable connect emotionally anyone help cope .

performance actor and actress ( film ) be excellently natural which be what movie acting should be ; and direct skill be so brilliantly handle detail be never tired see over and over again . however , be rather surprise see film be notinclude actor ' and director , Attenborough 's credit puzzle : be n't proud make claim have make such excellent , long lasting film audience ? be hope would get answer my puzzle one ( possibly one " knowledgeable " personnel ( insider ) film .

admit first 20 minute or so film be n't entirely sure be go sit whole thing . many other people , find pretty boring , and be n't entirely look forward hour and half watch guy bite icicle and stick together . however , sit creation his first work long enough see finished product , get idea how impressive rest film be . really think be sad so many people find impossibly boring or retread idea do other artists.Rivers and Tides be quiet study artwork and method Andy Goldsworthy , who make his art entirely out thing nature , generally result piece that will be consume nature normal process entropy . be slow move and unglamorous , but think lot point movie be show Goldsworthy 's art do notneed accompaniment order be appreciate . have even hear people complain about how be always talk movie , rather just let nature and his artwork speak , which just think be madness.On other hand , lot people complain CD come lyric write out . lot musician as well think their music should mean whatever listener want mean musician show exact lyric , guess be just kind person that believe will like know what artist be try accomplish his or her artwork . can still take how want even know what be mean do . can understand notwant hear talk movie . do , , lose his train thought and find unable explain his work more one occasion , but do n't want Goldsworthy talk his art be watch film , feel free turn sound off . be notread lyric do n't want know what musician be sing and would rather interpret word yourself.I think Andy Goldsworthy 's work , which have idea exist watch movie , be incredibly impressive , and be glad film be make order showcase . indeed , his work be generally notkind that can be transport studio , photography be only medium other film that can express , and really appreciate be able see work that go his art , and way only thing nature be use . or notappreciate certain aspect how film be present , Goldsworthy 's work be move enough overlook , film be notstar , Goldsworthy 's art be . and give lack music or even small special effect and slow-moving nature film , seem director Thomas Riedelsheimer know .
This be dramatic film whole sense word . tell tail here Greece live routine everyday life realize how sad be . sure have extremes. . but now and then real life sorrow surpass art.It be deeply critical goal pursue and whole social structure build . film have deep understanding Greek way life , stereotype , and social structure . most Greek film that have certain fast-food-mainstream audience , one do nottarget anyone particular but watch feel someone put well possible word and picture describe your feeling . be notbig fan traditional music either but would n't like hear anything else when be play film.If someone tell say something film will define following , sometimes transition scene seem sudden or somewhat cut . guess edit have cut up fit 2hours and bit theatres..Anyway could write more and more express my thought but guess u have see and discuss friend . must see
time , overtake thing my favourite horror film . Carpenter 's film be more efficient and more entertaining flick , Kubrick 's be more artistic , more thought-provoking , and probably scary . be one few film where can look its flaw and truly and wholly love . try notcompare book which have only read once , number year ago , and which scare death two do n't have lot common , story and character obviously . be almost as Kubrick be bank people 's love novel order make his film more frightening . and way , be certainly one most interesting book adaptation ever make , as well one great horror films.What make film so terrifying be notjump scare , notblood and gore , notvarious ghost that pop up time time . be destruction Jack Torrence . people have complain casting Nicholson role , say be too obvious be go go crazy film , give his past role and his appearance . disagree . know be go go crazy most have read book and Jack 's appearance only further notion . but be way act beginning that make truly scare . be calm , quiet , patient . engage inane small talk hotel manager and even his own family . and wife and son irritate his , be small wonder manage do so . but once get overlook , change . become irritable , angry , edge . scene that always shock be when Wendy interrupt type , and utterly lose , tell " leave f*** alone " . be first f-bomb drop film , and be shock system . then on , bet be off.Another thing love be multiple interpretation present film . be never really sure what be see be actually happen . many critic have note whenever Jack talk ghost , there be mirror present , show may as well be talk . but what other character ? Wendy never see anything film 's climax , be give tour hotel 's many ghostly inhabitant , but be well aware something be wrong , Danny connect place almost immediately . his psychic power be notquestion how else would Hallorann know come hotel ? but do ever see ghost his parent witness ? be easy claim Jack merely lose , be trap hotel his family , and Wendy later do well see your husband attempt kill axe will do but what Danny ? appear his body be take over Tony , but how do know sure ? none character be reliable witness . Hallorann probably would be , and warn danger 237 , but be kill as soon arrive Overlook ( scare Kubrick achieve play assumption fan novel ) . and final shot . have there ever be more enigmatic ending cinema ? have Jack really be there before ? or be his body merely ' absorb ' hotel ? when talk acting film , discussion begin and end Jack Nicholson . Shelley Duvall give one most annoy performance cinematic history probably purpose , give Jack 's character more reason snap and Danny Lloyd be no good , but Jack be powerhouse . part method , part improvisation , be simultaneously terrifying and appealing . well or bad , be character whom identify , notannoy kid or nagging wife . all want have hotel season , be able do whatever want . who care be haunt ? course , technical aspect be terrific . Kubrick 's long take , strange angle , and bizarre imagery all contribute horror . use colour , mirror , long hallway , and other motif only heighten . and do n't even get start score . do n't know film would be as scary haunting , electronic tune . its strangeness perfectly reflect hotel , mood , and entire film itself.I know King do n't like film , but King 's input cinema be nothing brag about . as great novel writer may be , his screenplay be terrible , and his attempt directing be well leave unnoticed . be notvery faithful book adaptation , but do n't need be , and really should n't . part horror film be viewer do n't have book fall back ; there be reassuring source material . Kubrick masterfully alter narrative terrify audience even more . only , be one most innovative film genre . and have get everything else top .

" come age " film deal experience two young girl , Dani and Maureen , learn life and love one fateful summer.Directed Robert Mulligan , famous his superb work " Kill mockingbird , " film never hit false note . all acting be superb . Dani , Reese Witherspoon make stunning film debut . watch beautifully photograph and superbly direct and edit film , feel be look window reality , rather watch movie.I have watch movie least 5 time , and can honestly say be one single good movie ever make be young , being love , and go feeling , challenge , and change young adulthood . family child 10 and 15 should watch together , and use discussion piece , raise number issue sibling rivalry , how deal be love , responsibility parent , etc.
[ Warning : contain SPOILERS]I have adult friend whom notion her parent have sex make her terribly uneasy . come mind when reflect audience 's reaction " Mother."People gasp when May ( Anne Reid ) writhe passionately bed her young hunk lover , Darren ( Daniel Craig ) or later see sexually explicit drawing May . doubt audience be aghast nudity or drawing ' content much feel uneasy see woman her 60s rapturously enjoy sex.Screenwriter Hanif Kureishi ( " my Beautiful Laundrette , " " My Son Fanatic " ) again prove why be most trenchant storyteller side Atlantic . his story be noteasy take . searing family drama be n't film can claim enjoy watch be raw , complex , and often make very uncomfortable . nevertheless , be powerfully good stuff.Kureishi and Roger Michell ( who direct " Notting Hill , " thing ) craft unsentimental , wrenching and superbly-acted portrait old woman who realize , all year , can and should still enjoy all life 's pleasure . wonderfully epiphanous moment , when her son , Bobby , ask notbe difficult , May shoot back , " why not? " why not, indeed.Anne Reid deserve Oscar nomination her turn May . be subtle , restrained , powerful and sad , often all same time . watch Reid when May observe Darren and Paula ( Cathryn Bradshaw ) seemingly passionate clutch pub . or , when beg Paula open front door disastrous date . Reid 's eye and face reveal May 's anguish and despair . film 's most devastating moment , May drop her knee Darren , willing do anything , only ask be kind . be tremendously gutsy performance remarkable actress.I enjoy Michell 's use natural sound , especially when May and Toots first arrive Bobby 's place . perfectly illustrate cacophony May and Toots , flippant manner which their own family welcome them.This film , time , remind honesty and rawness Mike Leigh 's work , " Mother " hang slight sense optimism keep afloat.My one quibble : Michell 's decision give May and Darren 's first love scene almost cheesy sensibility . lover remain out focus while , foreground , white curtain flutter gently breeze . and only sound be May throes passion.The problem Michell 's approach be Reid and Craig , who completely envelop role Darren , plough their way so fearlessly role be unfair hide their character ' almost primitive energy audience . especially Michell have qualm make late sex scene visceral.This film do n't have immensely likable character . sympathize May , but , too , cause her daughter 's suffering . but doubt Kureishi intend people his story likable folk . his point , believe , be unmask family that be already crack when something emotionally cataclysmic happen . be unflinching its candor and ultimately unforgettable .

' Odyssey ' have see since have be enormous let-down . character series seem genuine , real people - ancient Greek people - and notHollywood star costume . be real masterpiece ! but - why be notwell know ? and why be n't available VBS or DVD ? would just love have chance see again !

This be one well animated movie have ever see my life . be n't just fun movie , or well-made movie . be landmark art animation and even be n't , just technical skill that go make , would grant place history animation.Wladyslaw Starewicz create stop-motion movie secret life beetle . imagine coherent world insect , job , house , nightclub , movie house , even little prop poster and bicycle and paintings.In movie tell simple tale hypocrisy and revenge . Mr. Beetle have affair dancing dragonfly , much chagrin grasshopper ; but be cameraman and decide shoot fling . Mr. Beetle return home and find Mrs. Beetle have her own affair . Mr. Beetle chase lover away but forgive his wife . two make up and go out movie . and movie watch be Mr. Beetle and Dragonfly . describe thus sound banal , but once see become gripping work cinema . Emile Cohl and Jiri Trnka , Wladyslaw Starewicz pretty much invent everything future animator would use their work . reason must notremain forget .

King Vidor 's direction be one principle reason . producer ? boy genius , Irving Thalberg.It be about movie make , and get see process be do 1928 , camera , set , director direct and actor emote . get see ( briefly ) major star day ; even Charlie Chaplin do turn , seek autograph . also catch glimpse Eleanor Boardman , Elinor Glyn , Claire Windsor , King Vidor , and many other who be otherwise just name and old photographs.Please , even be notfan silent , take time catch film when can . be really terrific trip back time .
 Yes , be flawed - especially be Hollywood film that demand lot effect , purely entertaining or fantasy story or plot , and ca n't actually think yourself.Roeg 's film be intelligent film-goer , and Insignificance be perfect example.The characterization be brilliant , story be excellent , but , Nic Roeg 's film - have think level aspect reality that would never have dawn before . his film always make think , and personally , like film.So do n't expect come away watch film and feel happy-happy , be likely will be disappointed.But think be excellent .
most 70s ( and 80s ) Kong Kong martial art film barely function movie ; usually there be few well-plan fight sequence , but plot be scrape pretty thin fill gap node -- porno film , really.But one do several thing well . most overtly , there be direction and choreography , which confine combatant ' style ' -- be really base Chinese circus acrobatics and comedic theater , but effect works.Second , there be language camera , which use impressive techniques(even today 's measure ) , change projection speed real time time slow motion , and unfiltered filter view depict story direction past or future.Least overt , but most powerful and unexpected , be construction . winner contest be determine who ' unfold ' story . master ( writer ) set up game where lead character do n't know who be seek , which be same situation viewer find in . One one , figure out who be who , same rate find who be who . all follow tragedy/noir arc . ending tend irony , la " Sting " . much more clever stuff what usually get out genre.The ' five venom ' idea be template Tarantino 's ' deadly viper assassin ' " Kill Bill " volume .
B movie go , be well average ( warn reader now may reveal certain key element plot or other part movie , be try minimise such tendency ) . sequel usually go , be utterly fantastic(despite " cookie cutter " approach try copy certain element original movie verbatum . sometimes tedious tendency , seem work particular film , so long viewer could divorce his attention comparison original " Scanners").The movie be similar way " Superman " series , term main character 's description his early childhood and relationship his parent ( who seem model same line Kent " Superman " story ) and theme morally pure hero possess extraordinary power early age , etc. depiction profound feeling alienation prodigious or otherwise non-conforming child , adolescent and/or adult be theme which remind film such " Real Genius " , and ( more superficial degree ) " Doctor Mordrid " and strike particularly strong chord.The film have positive message , and be fun watch . find insight and accuracy ( term depiction certain aspect paranormal experience ) fascinating , and even profoundly touching time . moment occasionally appear great formula-driven schlock and gratuitous sex(uality , case , sexual element be tastefully do ) and violence that make B movie ( or Shakespearian play , matter ! ) so much fun watch ! be must watch comic book , Sci-fi , " remote viewing " enthusiast , and horror fan ! right exposure right circle , film could develop quite cult following , along original " Scanners " .

My 3 year old love . love , my wife love . so 10 10 our family . as violence level ? notreally violent , mostly slap stick variety . nobody truly die , gore , blood , torture , so certainly be appropriate child , much more so many Saturday morning cartoons.This movie really take idea CG movie where should go.First beautiful graphics , texture wonderfully do , true depth , nottry be realistic , but form artistic whole . moss stone , rust metal , relief wood and stone , everything add whole.Character modeling , many contemporary CG movie , be quirky , notcute , again artistic whole . face may look less malleable other movie , but character be more puppet-like human-like . think be good thing , lend veracity , how strangely may sound , be easy suspend your disbelief.Hair , fur , clothing , par , least likes Pixar . just note open scene when Lian-Chu be fight giant slug ; Gwizdo be front farmer , and have detailed clothing which cause pause movie just admire it.The setting . far like car , and even Walle . Space have be do many time , but fantasy environ Dragon Hunters be only comparable scene Never Ending Story and Lord Rings , but again be artistic whole , and lot good idea throw about effortlessly . magnificent vista scene Monsters Inc. where ride all doorway its storage facility , or Walle where see immense trash tower make , abound movie , everything be grand , yet never dwell upon ; be just background whole way ! interlude where walk area fantastic fall . Chinese wall , island float sky . Broccoli sky ? be truly where believe CG should go , make something which take your breath away , and do again and again.The sound be good , music be vary and notonly epic , and thankfully vocal , and purely original movie.Animation be quite good . lend its inspiration cartoon , especially good use stretch and squeeze . sometimes notrealistic , but 3d model be notrealistic either.Characterization be well do too . Lian-Chu gentle and uncertain giant be gradually grow confidence bask attention little Zo.Gwizdo wily manager Lian-Chu redeem end , Zo be n't really change , but who want cute child change anyway ? least love Lian-Chu more other recent character Sulley Monsters Inc.The internal strife group get iron out external pressure , just should proper fantasy story.The story be mostly reminiscent Never Ending Story , especially how world brake apart . monster be pretty standard fare , flock one . lack emotional impact Walle , which be really strong point movie , but be much more fun ride , and lack annoy musical scene replay former one , and have action first scene . movie be what want watch fun and exciting time.The whole movie have , have mention whole vision , which seem have be follow rigorously throughout.It seem , setting be ready more adventure , and would hope so.One side note , French actor do Lian-Chu sound bit Jean Reno first , but be happy be n't , be one my favorite . nice hear new , , voice.I give max rating , bit surprise mediocre and low rating ; have try address concern make two review low vote . approach movie adventure , and European movie , notoppose Hollywood , but different .

Hope Davis have small , but subtly effective support role Kinnear 's wife ( what be her name " Bean " ? ) who happen get little excited when have facilitator her live room.The visual and setting be perfect - include bullfight , racetrack and Denver suburb . and how often do get Killers and Xavier Cugat same soundtrack ? one be definitely noteveryone , but your sense humor be bit center and enjoy risky film-making , could be .

' Country ' be cold and bleak film can really admire , while ' Devil ' be bit more enjoyable . there be definitely less violence ' Devil ' ' country . ' acting deliver as well . Ethan Hawke , sometimes wooden past , bring jitter , sweat and deer-in-the-headlights-look besieged Hank . Philip Seymour Hoffman , Andy , have film 's hard scene and be fast become actor , who believe can do anything.There be really notmuch wrong film . jump back and forth be confusing . event spiral out control , but film never do - writing ( first timer Kelly Masterson ) , directing ( veteran Sidney Lumet ) and edit stay tight drum . many category , be award caliber stuff , though maybe film ' Departed ' and ' No Country ' squeeze one out limelight . like , will like .

 Opening credit : great . music : just right film . cinematography : sleazy great effect.Harrowing excitement train-wreck sort way . be how out control life can become . " wonderland " depict drug-induced wildness ( and its consequence ) notaberration , but show how really do happen our society . be good depiction wild group -Manson's- Manson film , book etc concentrate so much Manson 's insane mind rather overall picture cheap fame and randomness that be so pervasive nowadays.If want see good " Method-acting " film , watch Kilmer movie . show how " method " can be riveting right role.The filmmaker here succeed raise " out-of-control " level art form , notjust sake give cheap thrill .
wonderful 1983 BBC television production ( notmovie , other have write here ) classic love story " Jane Eyre " , star Timothy Dalton Rochester , and Zelah Clarke Jane , be fine version that have be make date , be most faithful novel Charlotte Bronte concept and dialogue.A classic become classic very specific reason ; when film producer start meddle classic 's very lifeblood then classic be destroy . thankfully producer This " Jane Eyre " approach story respect and faithfulness original , which result spectacularly addictive concoction that be worth view multiple time , enjoy its multi-layers sweetness and delight and suspense . performance be delightful , music be just right , even Gothic design house and outdoor shot be beautiful , and set right tone production.My only criticism , though slight , be version , other version ever make Jane Eyre , ignore Christian influence that build Jane 's character and influence her moral choice . today 's modern world woman Jane 's situation would n't think twice but stay Rochester find have insane wife and be still marry . " oh , just get divorce " , would say her man , or would live sin . but Jane Eyre know could n't settle course life and respect . why ? decision be base foundation Christian faith have be teach childhood , notbrutal Calvinist Lowood Institution , but Christian example true friend , Helen Burns , who be martyr rather notturn other cheek . someday would like see version depict influence little more fully adaptation . classic novel that end heroine write " even so , come Lord Jesus ! " should nothave foundation faith strip out .

Michael Canton Jones paint wonderful portrait honor and dishonor man can represent . but alas ... constantly , and unfairly get compare " Braveheart " . be two entirely different film , probably only similar fact be about Scots historical Scotland . yet , comparison frequently bother seem be almost assume " Braveheart " be good film " Rob Roy " . like " Braveheart " lot , but idea compare " Rob Roy " be little insulting . put quite simply , love " Braveheart " , but be pale shadow how much love " Rob Roy " . here be my particular reason ... -"Rob Roy " be about real people.Let 's face , William Wallace " Braveheart " be notreal person . be legend , martyr , large life figurehead . depiction , be also perfect person , never do wrong , and basically show his Scot countryman promised land . when finally do fail , be nothis fault . Jesus , be betray very people trust most . even go bad kind torture want freedom much.The depiction Wallace be very well do and effective . but really do n't inspire or intrigue . find human ambiguity far more facinating human perfection . be why " last Temptation Christ " be good film " King Kings " , and be also one reason why think " Rob Roy " be good " Braveheart " . Rob Roy may be heroic and brave , but be far perfect . make several mistake that affect life many his love one . now sure , notbear false claim Duke Argyll be act nobility and courage , but be also act egoism and self centeredness . let notforget kinfolk have claim protect be drive homeless end film act . but Rob do good could , and be could ask him.Rob 's Wife Mary , be also normal , ambigious person . let start though , how look film . sure , be beautiful , but do n't wear makeup and basically allow her natural beauty show . compare two love ( or one , depend your point view ) William Wallace " Braveheart " . now two lady be hot , but hardly indicitive how woman look time ( especially lay person ) . maybe notfair comparison , but just example how Rob Roy 's attempt accuracy be far more effective.Throughout " Rob Roy " , Mary have live her vicious rape dastardly carrion , Cunningham . feel compel tell Rob her struggle , but do n't know Rob must seek revenge her rape . such revenge would surely mean death Rob , and Mary be notprepare such sacrifice.The villain " Rob Roy " be equally as compelling . enemy " Braveheart " be well write , be hardly original . Robert Bruce , man both brave and cowardly , be plague moral decision that be all familar fictional realm . should take his claim king Scotland , or should betray Wallace order ensure safety his family name ? Bruce be most ambigious character " Braveheart " , but Brutus " Julius Ceasar " Fredo " Godfather Part II " , type character be hardly original . Longshanks , compelling villain his own right , be very one dimensional . be epidemy evil , and his tyrant way stand direct contrast Wallace 's heroism."Rob Roy " have three villain that be wonderful their chicanery . first , let 's start Marquis Montrose . be man who be so obsessed his self image , be willing let innocent man suffer . " see be notmock " be his favorite word his " factor " . be man obsess power , upset man great noble bearing Duke Argyll can be consider great providency then . be shamefully self obsessed and insecure . be evil aristocrat , but way that make unique.Cunningham and Callarn be conspirator " Rob Roy " , and be also Roy 's direct assailant . Callarn be so cunning his cowardace be almost comical . will do anything maintain good will Marquis , which include backstabbing and trickery . Cunningham be compelling character that seem have be raise do whatever can obtain status and affection Marquis . need father , little do know Marquis be his real father . therefore , when opportunity obtain wealth come Callarn , grab even question . be very much evil modern man , self center and vain care notconsequence his action others.Many have criticize Tim Roth 's performance film overact . hogwash say . be clear Cunningham be notsimply evil but also psychopath film . world where man and his stepson can go shoot random people amusement , be Cunningham too much unbelievable character ? live society where people seem have decrease value human life . " Rob Roy " simply teach only circumstance decrease value have change . be problem human history vanity human heart will notallow capacity compassion . Rob Roy and Mary give hope goodness will prevail , but snake will always exist our world.Another character find fascinating be Duke Argyll . be true nobleman , and his value honesty and courtesy be direct contrast Marquis . appreciate bravery Rob Roy and Mary , and have direct vexation Marquis and his factor . give world hope people power . hopefully , people Marquis be exception and notrule.- final duel " Rob Roy " be more exciting then 10 battle scene " Braveheart".One thing get tired be people tell " Braveheart " be good film battle scene . first , battle scene be hardly original . " Spartacus " " Gladiator " , Hollywood have have long tradition historical European battle scene . " Braveheart " have good battle scene ever put film , but suffer one important problem . battle scene have context fight freedom.Now , do n't get wrong , duel be hardly original either . fact , there be probably 10 time many film duel there be battle scene . but context duel Cunningham and Rob Roy be beauty behold . be one great scene film history . let explain why ... first , fight style and bearing two character duel describe character perfectly . Cunningham be effette and dangerous , Rob Roy be strong and courageous . Cunningham use fencing sword Rob use broadsword . Cunningham fight quick tricky movement , Roy 's fight style be more obvious.The whole film , deliberately slow first half exciting second half , be lead up moment . be powerful stuff , and be clear Rob must exterminate menace evil that have plague his whole world . when Rob finally get upper hand ( literally and figuratively , ) be one great moment film history . Rob win have more live , and his honor be more powerful 10 Cunningham 's . use music be absolutely chilling scene . good prevail real evil be more powerful see dude get disembowel just so can yell " Freedom ! " . but hey , maybe be just me.- " Rob Roy " be more realistic " Braveheart"I do n't know people aristocracy or Scotsman talk people " Rob Roy " , but do feel clearly attempt capture their speech pattern . feel many people be bore " Rob Roy " simply ca n't understand what character be say . be case , then read Shakesphere , or put close-captioning . " Rob Roy " be actually one great written film 90 's . many dialogue film be clever , but maybe have watch film couple time understand it.By contrast , dialogue " Braveheart " be hardly very interesting . course , what do expect when main character be Scotsman play Australian ? be legend , and there be clearly notattempt capture speech time . film take place several century " Rob Roy " , and yet talk people today . thus reason many people like good . audience today have become increasingly lazy , and do n't want take time or patience understand thing that be complex . therefore , as many epic film , expect see villians speak recognizable English accent hero speak vernacular nottoo far away our American language . sure , be clear Wallace be Scotish , but other sound Scotty Star Trek and couple " Aye"s acknowledgement , Scot film fit Hollywood tradition how believe Scot should sound.So , do description prove " Rob Roy " be good film " Braveheart " ? hardly . but prove one thing , show be hardly common knowledge " Braveheart " be good film " Rob Roy " . put simply , " Rob Roy " be film that have theme that be very apropos today 's world . " Braveheart " be film legend that be inspiring but hardly realistic . can make decision what think be good ... Grade - score - 9
fast pace and funny satire original " reality TV " , soap opera . script playwright Robert Harling be pack one liner and ridiculous situation . good be climax , live broadcast that quickly deteriorate bad improv and brain transplant .

what do do 14-inch cock porn star who be involve drug and murder , and then die AIDS ? make movie , course . probable reason why be n't make earlier be fact Eddie Nash would have be way its production . so be coincidence film be make just little while Nash be send prison.The good thing movie be its quick pace . there be time waste unnecessary crap . and why would be ? there be too much good material here require dull filler scenes.The cast be good . Kilmer have be mediocre string movie , so here be finally role quite suitable . Bosworth be cute be irrelevant how act ( be solid ) , and McDermott , who be otherwise quite annoy , be rather good , large extent be wear so much facial hair do n't recognize first . ( wish do Cruise movie would n't have watch his dumb face . ) utterly fail recognize Christina Applegate , and would n't have know be , have notsee her name end-credits . Kudrow be charm as ever , bit unusual see dramatic role . ( Btw , " friend " be bad TV sitcom time . ) only casting choice that be questionable be early near-cameo Carrie Fischer and totally absurd inclusion 90s moron Janeane Garofalo . think will include Paris Hilton , too , do n't ? no , think Hilton be ideal choice her 10-second appearance dumb whore . film be about decadence , other thing and about porn actor fit perfectly .
Emilio Miraglia 's first Giallo feature , Night Evelyn Came Out Grave , be great combination Giallo and Gothic horror - and second film be even good ! have get more Giallo side equation time around , Miraglia do n't lose Gothic horror stylings that make early film such delight . Miraglia put more emphasis fine detail plot time around , and result be typical Giallo labyrinth , character all place and red herring be throw few minute . be definite bonus film , however , as can get little too confusing time ; there be always enough hold audience 's interest and Miraglia 's storytelling have improve his early movie . plot open scene that see two young girl fight , their grandfather explain legend rather lurid painting their castle . legend revolve woman call ' Red Queen ' who , legend have , return grave hundred year and kill seven people . few year later , murder begin occur ... even only make two Giallo 's , Miraglia do have his own set tribute . be obvious colour red be important , feature heavily film ; and appear have something woman call ' Evelyn ' . like castle , Gothic atmosphere and stylish murder too - which be fine ! Miraglia may be Argento when come spill blood , but certainly know how drop top murder his film ; and here have delight involve Volkswagen Beetle , and death iron fence that be one my time favourite Giallo death scene . female side cast be excellent stunning Barbara Bouchet and Marina Malfatti head up eye-pleasing cast lady that be n't afraid take their clothes off ! score courtesy Bruno Nicolai be catchy , and even do n't feature much psychedelic rock hear Night Evelyn Came Out Grave ; fit film well . ending be something turn-off , as Miraglia rev up Gothic atmosphere , come across be more little bit rush and identity murderer be too obvious . but even so , be delightfully entertaining Giallo and one that highly recommend fan genre !
Ella be excellent , Franchot be unavoidably over-the-top ( but play similar part other film such " man Eiffel Tower " ) and Alan be nearly non-existent but film certainly " thrilled".*mild spoiler ahead* : wonder how many time Elisha Cook get strangle his film but seem recall various other example . will avoid name murderer but think be necessarily obvious plot " thriller " demands.A very well-done but dated film noire ( example : everyone smoke crazy and police be really stock character . and dead body be ever show , today 's gore fests . ) do familiar short-scene tableau format period.8 out 10 .
first see film when be about 8 year old TV UK ( where be call " Laupta : Flying Island " ) . absolutely love , and be heartbroken when be repeat while later and miss . be enchant story and character , but most haunting and beautiful music . would have be original English dub version which see - sometimes erroneously refer " Streamline Dub " ( dub be actually Ghibli and only distribute Streamline ) which be sadly unavailable part ridiculously expensive laser disc box-set.Unfortunately feel release have be partly spoil Disney . voice acting be OK but dialogue do n't have same raw energy " streamline " dub or original Japanese have , and think James Van Der Beek sound too old play lead . have make pointless alteration , such change main character 's name " Pazu " " Patzu " , and add dialogue . but bad feel have ruin many scene intrusive music - opening scene airship example be originally silent but have be spoiled thanks Disney 's moronic requirement there be music playing whenever anyone be notspeak , which find annoy many Disney films.This film still blow away most recent animated film , and can recommend highly enough . plot be simple yet captivating and film show flair which be sadly miss most modern mass-market , homogenize animation .
ever want know just how much Hollywood could get away Hayes Code be officially put effect ? well , unfortunately " Convention City " be lose , so well just have watch " Tarzan and his Mate " find out . 1934 , there be remarkable amount sexual innuendo and even expose flesh . just look Jane 's nude swim . Tarzan be often think b-adventure film make young boy and one else , picture prove series be originally very adult . seventy year later , be still as sexy be when come out.In addition envelope push taboo nature , be superb and exciting adventure story . have always enjoy jungle film that Hollywood churn out 30s and 40s , but there be few genre will call great film . " Tarzan and his Mate " be far good film long go subgenre . sequence attack safari ape or native still manage create tension today . also , animal be all too cool ( espescially ape throw boulder ) . acting wo n't win major award soon , but be certainly more adequate type picture . film be once again steal Cheetah , smart monkey jungle . One most entertaining example pre-code Hollywood there .
there be comment film that say be bad and silly one and such excellent actor Pierre Fresnay should nothave accept act it.I think , just opposite , that , even when film be strange and have weakness , performance Pierre Fresnay be so formidable convert film something excellent.His performance be probably good history.The film have very polemic scene consecration wine cabaret.For somebody who do notbelieve priest even defrock can convert Christ 's blood , scene be perhaps bizarre . but somebody who have be raise catholic framework , be very emotive even quite unpleasant.The scene death young priest be tremendously shocking . but be very well act . Pierre Fresnay turn crazy act murder something understandable temporal madness his character , tortured defrock Morand who , terrible way , come back his duty .

" offside " be obviously cry justice , but be one that be make all more effective its refusal make its story heavy-breathing tragedy . instead , realize nothing break down social barrier quite as efficiently humor and appeal audience 's common humanity . and be n't what true art be suppose be all about ? its own quiet , understate way , " Offside " be one great , under-appreciated gem 2007 .

absolutely brilliant film ! Jiri Trnka , master puppet animation , confront totalitarianism , his final , film . would be ban communist Czechoslovakian government ( time ) , take country 's high animation award.In dark and entertaining short film , artist attempt create new pot his favourite plant . happily make his creation dream his plant will grow be beautiful rose . sudden , here be knock door , and in come giant omnipotent hand , that try force artist make statue 's likeness . artist resist good can , but eventually become overwhelm constant attempt , hand , force conform . become brainwash ; intellectual zombie . point hand attach string artist , put cage , and use make hand statue . all while glorify artist 's work and award medal and honours.The artist 's inner lust be able express freely be what help prevail over his indoctrination , and enable escape his prison , be literal or his mind , and return his home where now must live constant fear wrath omnipotent hand . shut in , think be out reach almighty hand , but process put his plant and pot up high , hope be out reach hand , and end up fall his head , kill . artist be inevitabally destroy his own creation . all constant fear have live once escape hand 's string . once dead , hand paint artist great person , national hero . unfortunately notcircumstance or reason artist would like be remembered.Trnka 's condemnation Totalitarian society , and their lack right free expression be dark , damn and amazingly animate . be wonder government ban be sort medium people admire , and would perhaps even listen . be obviously notacceptable . amazing example artist civil disobedience and impact can have . and still quite relevant today many part world , US middle east . must see and definite 10 10 ! talk go out bang !
This be typical grade B movie 1940s Hollywood and yet succeed way its expectation . why ? have wonderful plot and back up Nina Foch , George MacReady and Dame May Witty , female villain , people.When young lady answer advertisement secretary , certainly get more bargain . only talent her employer be seek be which will lead her demise . seem Witty and MacReady want pass off their daughter-in-law and wife , respectively . MacReady kill his real wife and want do Foch as well so body can be claimed.The film deal how Foch try get town people believe and how be thwart practically everything do . why do n't people believe ?
" Sandra , make Woman " be standout exploitation film , and be so two reason : ( 1 ) excellent , yet effortless , performance Monica Gayle , and ( 2 ) fact Gary Graver be helm project . two talent , both whom be quite underrate , make " Sandra " film that should be seen.Another key element film 's success be its realism -- there be nothing fake or " Hollywood " set-in-California film . be truly slice life . modest house which Sandra live beginning film , simple dress wear character , scene where Sandra wake up morning find Uschi Digart bounce her front door , and Sandra sit couch make-up , Digart try sell cosmetic , look truly as just wake up ( but nevertheless beautiful ) , harmless weirdo Sandra pick up who like make love wear bra , one-room apartment which Sandra move -- element film seem totally real , and as such , viewer be draw Sandra 's little world beginning and immediately become interested and want succeed . Sandra also make her case free love eloquence and dignity and come off lot class.This film could have easily fail less competent hand , and could have go off usual sexploitation direction , but Garver/Gale team see " Sandra " be notonly making woman but making excellent film .
see film when be originally release 1989 . enjoy then , and still do now . but what realize now be be quite " adult " film G rating , especially notion die and go Heaven . Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise work wonderfully together , and Reynolds ' singing voice be appropriate junkyard dog . there be good song range upbeat ( " let be make music together " ) downright emotional ( " home My Heart " ) . find plot good , do go off tangent once or twice . final scene film Charlie and Anne-Marie be one sad have ever see animation . film worth experience .
movie set out be good average action movie and that regard succeeded.This movie have spectacular cinematography feature spectacular mountain snow and heights,a very fit Stallone put good performance well,an exciting plot,and great performance 's main villain becouse will really shock his evil ways.The movie do notrank time great becouse weak screen play.The plot and story cry movie make Stallone extra special human,much Rambo or Rocky or Bond movie characters.They choose humanise Stallone 's character one which be ok but consider plot 's style,weakens excitement factor.Also,the dialogue be cheesy and carelessly condescend times.The script should have be more realistic and less " talky".Another weak point be unrealistic shooting scenes.The movie maker should have be more carefull how hadled shoot hit and misses.They should have continue quality scene shoot sequence plane hijack early movie.Instead,they decide water down lot shooting sequence ( ala " A-Team " TV series ) as soon villain set foot mountain tops.This movie have lot time great potential.Crisper action sequences,better dialogue and more Rambo/Rocky style emotion/determination Stallone would have take movie high level.I know be notStallone 's fault.I sense movie 's director want tone down Stallone 's character and try steal movie take credit his direction which be notall great nothis cinematographer.Sill good movie though ... ... . .

 Animation always seem be fringe . Japan , might notbe case , but Europe and much more so USA animation have big fat " Kids " tag . France be probably one more comic-liberal country , home classic Tin-Tin , Asterix , Lucky Luke , Valereon and so on(if have never read , be nottoo late . there be upper-age limit and do n't carry nerd-stigma DC or Marvel ) seem natural movie one pop up France . suit my prejudiced image French art-loving , anti-USA-oriented and talented movie-makers . luckily there be also " scanner darkly " there suppress view - seem art be pretty much international.Anyway , might have gather Renaissance be artsy and French . be normal person will get scared . there be need however ! be cool , sleek cel-shaded appearance there be good thriller and good movie overall.That be one my fear movie . be so easy turn spectacular animation gimmick , much Sony & C:o be do their Pixar rip-off . be expect confusing , sometimes boring and notvery engaging movie , but luckily be wrong.I would have enjoy anyway neo-noir stuff , but be good be worthwhile level well . note : have see French dub which be OK as far could see . English might be more interesting what Craig and everything.A final word praise animation . be awesome . futuristic , well-crafted , nice camera-work , smart solutions(Eyes example look very good , which be hard do ) and so visually stunning feel burst " be so damn impressive ! " . then again , really like animation and appreciate effort studio put down , my verdict be bit biased.Good movie anyway , definitely live be " gimmick " .

William Shakespeare would be very proud particular version his play . notonly be good movie version , but be also only complete version Hamlet . Kenneth Branagh 's Hamlet be simply genius . notonly be write Shakespeare , but also have gut do whole thing , even go just four hours.We all know story Prince Denmark and his plot avenge his father 's death , so wo n't go detail story . will , however , tell good part Hamlet version be notbreathtaking set or stunning photography , but actor ' interpretation character . doubt will find good Polonius Richard Briers ' delicious portrayal . plus , ca n't go wrong Julie Christie and Jack Lemmon . also , Derek Jacobi , regular Shakespeare adaptation be magnificent antagonist Hamlet.Of course , must talk Kenneth Branagh . wow audience when come scene his first outing Shakespeare , Henry V. outdo Hamlet . sure , Olivier 's presence be captivating , but think Branagh 's performance be wonderful . when watch screen , be almost as know exactly how Shakespeare want role be play . how be n't nominate Oscar be total mystery . least movie get few nomination and even odd choice Screenplay . guess know good writing when see though.All , will never find more rich and lavish production Bard 's good play . say technical aspect be awesome would be understatement . love play and be fan Shakespeare , definitely need check movie out . even do n't really care Shakespeare , visual will keep occupy duration film . may notthink will be able sit once , but will soon find out pause movie will make want see even more .
see " dance film " , and be awesome . really feel Jake . talk add insult injury ! notonly be your parent get divorce , but there be monster you.It be heartfelt and scary -- there be several moment where audience scream genuine fright . kind remind Japanese horror film , that story be actually good.And that be what separate " Jake 's Closet " usual indy film pabulum -- excellent script compelling character . also , mix element horror film family drama , movie get good out genre , and avoid clichs both.If be notcome out theater , definitely get DVD .
 Reign be success due powerful work Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle . comedic actor go dramatic have be see as somewhat distraction , Sandler be stranger play more serious role . most character portray have unstable temperament and vulnerability that can burst moment . might even be typecast character such hidden anger problem . however , performance have considerable dramatic weight , his role less comedic fare Punch-Drunk Love and Spanglish.In film , Alan Johnson ( Cheadle ) run his old college roommate , Charlie Finerman ( Sandler ) , whom have n't see several year . Five year before , Charlie suffer overwhelming loss his wife and three daughter plane crash . Charlie barely even recognize Cheadle 's character due repression his memory and consequent reclusive childish lifestyle accident . be n't Alan persist engage conversation Charlie remember who be . their renewed relationship that follow will allow Finerman have friend who do n't speak his loss , eventually enable confront thought and feeling have suppress his own terms.Though writer-director Mike Binder do n't show much sense individual style and his shot and transition be bit awkward , do have knack get decent great performance his actor be talented and funny writer . shoot film digital camera , as more and more filmmaker be do today , enable crew shoot night scene limited lighting . keep colorful background New York City focus , but result create frequent digital grain , which resemble blue speck scatter and move screen.Almost main character Reign give great performance . Jada-Pinkett Smith and especially Liv Tyler be memorable their respective role frustrated wife Cheadle 's character and psychiatrist . however , be Sandler and Cheadle that give their fine work date . completely own movie . Sandler actually play character that do n't outwardly resemble or act , partially credit his Bob Dylan-esquire wig . Cheadle 's character have more screen time Sandler , both should be consider be lead role , equally support and help other film.Music also play great part film , especially title song " Reign , " or " Love , Reign O'er Me " who , and later cover Pearl Jam . one most powerful moment film , Binder show Sandler use music shut out his feeling and memory , but particular song provoke such intense emotion rather diminish his anger , incite his emotion . all all , Reign be enjoyable , sad , yet many times funny film , drive its amazing lead performance .

Cheeta be quite charming well , take drag off Martin 's cigarette . plot be mostly excuse Tarzan do battle jungle 's most vicious animal , especially lion , crocodile , and rhino . effect , though always visible , be much more dynamic and cool and complement action nicely . oh , and ca n't talk movie talk nude swimming scene . all can say be : yes , be naked . very exciting stuff.KEVIN : wow . just wow . when come down-and-dirty pre-code action/adventure , nothing hold candle ' Tarzan and his Mate . ' inevitable sequel Tarzan Ape Man be kick-ass , violent and risqu jungle epic . doubt there will be Tarzan movie future that take prisoner way one do . will be hard press find full scene movie that would be Code-approved , or Animal Rights-approved matter . gruesome violence do n't even wait happy jungle couple show up push even limit today 's adventure movie . and T&J ; enter picture , there be plenty early morning cuddle and ass-naked afternoon swim . see do n't believe . love Maureen O'Sullivan most film . first film , Jane seem walk contradiction , writer back then just do n't know how portray character . but here be great precursor kick-butt female late cinema . still require Tarzan 's assistance get out most jam , do lot more just wait around be rescue . her personality be perfectly believable woman who have be live ( relatively ) comfortably jungle year . watch my Mom , and enjoy point out just how much Jane have Tarzan " train , " Jeff Foxworthy put . totally have ape man beck and call . there be host dated optical effect film , there be still plenty hair-raising Tarzan vs. predator battle that be perform ( mostly ) real . and men-dressed-as-apes be lot more convincing time around . **SPOILER** film climax jungle erupt shocking orgy animal kingdom violence that leave Tarzan and Jane only two human still breathe . couple ride off sunset reunite and victorious , ca n't help but imagine how story will seem next safari who will hear previous bunch human who go find Tarzan and Jane and be never hear again . **END SPOILER** One thing that still bother be Johnny Weissmuller 's smooth , hairless bod and over-styled coif . other , be pre-Code action-adventure that be absolutely notbe missed.Last film : happen One Night ( 1934 ) . next film : twentieth century ( 1934 ) .
agree many negative review post here , reason will go later on . but miniseries be powerful and convincing talented cast really capture dark truth Hitler 's world.Peter Stormare be perfect Ernst Rohm , brutal Brownshirt leader . scene have Hitler be explosive ! Hitler be so evil dominate everyone but thuggish , primitive Rohm -- and clearly dig Rohm just reason . interplay Stormare and Carlisle illuminate way Hitler relish Rohm 's brutality , but later sacrifice political reasons.Jena Malone turn heartrending performance Geli Raubal , Hitler 's doomed niece and victim his unspeakable perversion . reveal sexual filth directly , Jena Malone play all horror slow extinction young girl 's spirit . use her eye and voice suggest all horror that will be visit million year come . and be brilliant ! Zoe Telford very nearly match Jena Malone her portrayal Eva Braun . Eva be clearly sick , cruel and heartless -- but same time almost pitiably dependent her Adolph 's twisted tenderness . aborted lovemaking scene ( hint spine tingle truth Hitler 's enormous self-loathing ) be chilling and erotic.Liev Schrieber give deliciously weasel-like performance Putzi Hanfstaengel , spineless man-about-town who be seduce Hitler 's promise wealth and power . brute Rohm simply love idea crush skull his boot , Schrieber 's character be one many Germans who abhor Nazi violence but ca n't resist quick and easy route money and power . his weak-willed fawn Hitler soon lose respect his wife , play style and sensuality stunning and regal Julianna Margulies . provide true portrait marriage and betrayal.These performance carry mini series along , easily overcome occasional weakness script . there be one exception . regrettably , Matthew Modine 's act chop just be n't up snuff . his noble lunk-haid journalist ruin scene have -- viewer can hardly wait Rohm 's brown-shirts stomp smug , righteous look his ignorant , corn-pone low-rent Hollywood golden boy face . but story still works.Now regard factual inaccuracy script -- Hitler 's perversion and cruelty be render vibrant , compelling drama . but battlefield record Corporal Hitler be badly distort . as afraid audience ca n't handle idea evil and courage same person , writer make Hitler look whine coward who " beg " Iron Cross . as anyone Kaiser 's Army could get medal just whine ! movie make look as Hitler be coward trench , when be fearless soldier . also suggest his comrade despise , when reality be widely admire officer and enlist man alike . depressing thing be mini-sery succeed so well represent Hitler monster honest way -- but just could n't resist cheap shot.All , however , Hitler : rise EVIL be soar success highlight powerful performance .
This be hilarious movie . One very good thing be quality performance actor . large role small , character be vivid , unforgettable and so understandable . can also make laugh so hard your health will improve .

have mention two failure understand movie brilliantly succeed where fail : " Scanner Darkly " and " Immortel Ad Vitam " . be excite concept two movie and feel woefully disappointed ( ) , will probably enjoy Renaissance . immerse world future Paris . be notquite dystopian . do animation so well think be rotoscoped , but what can tell , be not, be merely motion capture . facial expression be amazing ! notTRON have see fantasy world so well display animation/live hybrid . Black and White medium be use slowly direct your attention subject scene ; my favorite effect be what do headlight beam , watch . director play your attention and confusion but be satisfy eventually find thread want find . overall effect be harsh and gritty urban world fill small surprises.The plot be secondary , but be n't terrible . be noir-ish . there be backstory most major character give depth . there be weather . there be " set " can feel be different place Paris . there be action , and even car chase . be go have see one again get everything . also recommend very large screen view " set " be detailed and credit be small .
Francesca Annis , Michael Kitchen and Robson Green ! ! wow , what trio ... OK , so be Anna Karenina , but be good love story , very well-write and well-act . even few ' laugh-out-loud ' moment mix pretty serious observation fidelity , age bias , and parental aging/Alzheimer 's issues.Quirky guitar music add story well.While have be fan Ms. Annis ' ' Lillie ' ( ' 70s ) and Mr. Kitchen 's ' Buccaneers ' and ' Enchanted April ' , have only recently discover Mr. Green ( ' Me and Mrs. Jones ' , ' Touching Evil ' , etc. ) , make ask question - why have notsee ' Reckless ' recently ? ? ! ! admittedly more ' chick flick ' something man will sit through , be perfect rainy afternoon 's lazy viewing .
when come Paul Verhoeven and erotic thriller , most people think " basic instinct " and some maybe " Showgirls " . but Verhoeven have make his good erotic thriller year two movie : " De Vierde Man " . film be mesmerize and mindblowing - and all story be absolutely plausible , which make whole experience even more intense . performance Jeroen Krabbe , Renee Soutendijk and Thom Hoffman be exceptional , and Verhoeven 's direction do rest . " De Vierde Man " make even " basic instinct " look quite tame ... ca n't get much good , true classic erotic nightmare cinema . 10 out 10 , least ...
be genuine shame spin-off TV series inspire superior made-for-TV picture " Night Stalker " and " Night Strangler " only last single season and twenty episode , its good program offer often winning and highly entertaining blend sharp cynical humor ( Carl Kolchak 's spirited verbal spar match perpetually irascible and long-suffering editor Tony Vincenzo be always treat watch and hear ) , clever writing , nifty supernatural menace ( gotta love offbeat and original creature " Spanish Moss Murders , " " sentry , " and " Horror Heights , " plus ca n't go wrong such tried'n'true fright favorite zombie , vampire , werewolf , and witch ) , colorful character , lively act raft cool guest star ( legendary biker flick icon William Smith get rare chance tackle heroic lead " Energy Eater " other episode feature great veteran character actor Keenan Wynn , John Fiedler , John Dehner , Severn Darden , and William Daniels juicy role ) , effective moment genuine suspense ( sewer-set climax " Spanish Moss Murders " particular be truly harrow ) , and , good , one and only Darren Mcgavin peak zesty form brash , aggressive , and excitable , but basically decent , brave , and honest small-time Chicago , Illinois newspaper reporter Carl Kolchak.Kolchak be quintessential 70 's everyman protagonist , wily and quick-witted fellow strong nose tasty scoop and unfortunate knack get kind trouble . moreover , occasionally bumble Kolchak be anything but superhuman ; usually either trip or stumble run away deadly threat , yet possess certain inner strength and courage that enable save human race time and time again kind lethal otherworldly foe . Kolchak be surround handful enjoyable secondary character : Simon Oakland be perfect Carl 's chronically ill-tempered boss Tony Vincenzo , Jack Grinnage prissy Ron Updyke make ideal comic foil , Ruth McDevitt be simply delightful sweet Miss Emily Cowles , and Carol Ann Susi be likewise lot fun eager beaver rookie Monique Marmelstein ( who alas disappear pop up only three episode ) . grant , show do suffer lackluster make-up and special effect ( titular lycanthrope " Werewolf " unfortunately resemble Yorkshire terrier ! ) and latter episode boast few laughably silly monster ( headless motorcyclist " Chopper , " Cathy Lee Crosby Helen Troy " Youth Killer ' ) , but even second-rate show be redeem program 's trademark wickedly sly sardonic wit and Mcgavin 's boundless vitality and engagingly scrappy presence .
 Berlin-born 1942 Margarethe von Trotta be actress and now be very important director and writer . have be describe , perhaps even unfairly caricature , director whose commitment bring woman 's sensibility screen outweigh her artistic strength . " Rosenstrasse , " which have garner mixed and even strange review ( New York Times article be one most negatively aggressive review have ever read paper ) be notperfect film . be fine movie and testament rare coalesce successful opposition genocidal Nazi regime , people , generically powerless German demonstrate Berlin street.Co-writer von Trotta use actual Rosenstrasse incident context young woman 's search information her mother be never disclose life child German capital World War II.The husband Ruth Weinstein ( Jutta Lampe ) have die and surprising reversion orthodox Jewish lifestyle apparently hitherto long abeyance , Ruth notonly " sit shivah " ( Jews ' week-long mourn ritual ) but insist follow strict proscription her faith . her apartment New York City reflect affluence secure her deceased spouse 's labor . her American-born daughter , Hannah ( Maria Schrader ) and her brother be bit put-off mom 's assumption restrictive orthodox Jewish practice but pitch . mother coldly reject presence Hannah 's fiance , non-Jew name Luis ( Fedja van Huet ) . domestic crisis might well erupt Ruth warn will disown Hannah do n't give up dote , handsome Luis . stay tuned.A cousin arrive pay her respect and also drop clue interested Hannah wartime mystery mom 's childhood Berlin . Hannah be intrigue - query her mom who resolutely refuse discuss part her life . be very , very realistic . grow up parent who flee Nazi Germany just time and know many child whose family , whole but usually part , escape Holocaust . day be simply notdiscussed.So Hannah , have learn German gentile woman save Ruth 's life , traipse off Berlin hope find savior still breathe . be not, would have be very short film . but Ruth , pretend be historian , locate 90 year-old Lena Fischer ( Doris Schade ) , now widow . happy-to-be-interviewed but shake up repressed memory Lena tell her story , scene shift fairly seamlessly present day Berlin and war-time capital.The young Lena 1943 ( Katja Riemann ) be fine pianist marry Jewish violinist , Fabian Fischer ( Martin Feifel ) . advent Nazi regime be require use " Israel " middle name just Jewish woman have add " Sarah " their names(incidentally wish IMDb have notgive Fabian 's name its character list false " Israel " included-it simply perpetuate name apply Nazi mark classification and degradation).While Germany deport most its Jewish population concentration camp , marry " Aryan " be exempt . time . 1943 when regime decide take too ( most be man ; minority be Jewish woman marry non-Jews ) . roundup be show here all its frightening intensity.The young Lena try locate her husband . and many other woman know be be confine building Rosenstrasse . crowd anxious woman build up , piteously seek help German officer who predictably refuse aid and also verbally abuse ( " Jew-loving whore " be one appellation ) . subplot Lena more or less adopt eight-year-old Ruth who hide when her mother be seize ( remember , Ruth be now sit shiva Manhattan ) . child Ruth be fetchingly portray Svea Lohde.Through increasingly angry protestation woman finally prevail . man , and handful woman , be release . as real story Nazis give , one rare , almost unprecedented time when madman acknowledge defeat their homicidal agenda ( be termination euthanasia campaign rid Reich mental defectives and chronic invalid but be story).Von Trotta build up tension and woman 's story be personal and universal . Hannah continue prod age Lena who slowly , gather , begin suspect be notdeal ordinary historian but rather someone need learn girl rescue , child whose mother be murdered.The contrast Rosenstrasse 1943 , set , and street today bustle , rebuild , unified Berlin provide recur thematic element . Today 's Berlin bear heritage but notscar monstrous past . Von Trotta make point very well.The main actor be uniformly impressive . Lena 's husband strong be also show totally helpless snare confinement likely outlook deportation ( which be show have be clearly understand character - include local police and military - one-way trip oblivion ) . old Ruth be catalytically force confront demon long suppress her happy New York life . Hannah be very believable young woman whose father 's death trigger need discover her family 's past . thing happen ( Times 's critic appear notknow that).Von Trotta 's hand be sure but notperfect . scene Goebbels soiree enjoy Lena 's violin playing be unnecessary and distractive . suggestion may have go bed propaganda minister , most fanatical top-level Hitler worshiper , save her husband detract wondrous accomplishment demonstrate spouse and relative . most German officer come central casting and be mold Erich von Stroheim " copy and paste " school Teutonic nastiness . but be understandable.The Rosenstrasse story have be subject book and article and claim be paradigm case argue many more jew could have be save have more Germans protest . unfortunately argument be nonsense . German woman who occupy Rosenstrasse be deeply and understandably self-interested . most Germans be locate line somewhere passive and virulent anti-Semitism . be why Rosenstrasse protest be virtually singular . buy or reject Goldenhagen thesis most Germans be willing accomplice actual murderer just can notbe deny pre-Nazi endemic anti-Semitism erupt virulent strain 1933 on.The elderly Lena remark what be accomplish woman be " ray light " evil time . most man and woman spring near death trip survive war . so " ray light " be and von Trotta 's movie be beacon illumination show be save courage largely ordinary woman and life save occasion celebration exist . and always will.positive
first 2 part seek reduce absurdity rise wasteful war and rule nationalist barbarian . 3rd part speculate progress and exploration moon and beyond be key ensure meaningful use human talent and resource . have speech that viewer dismiss naive or bombastic but that make other tingle excitement . depict space gun/launcher and helicopter , along inventive mass communication device , elevator , flat screen panel , and wireless intercom . be probably incorrect windowless building future . but portray child-like vision boundless scientific/technological investigation.To , seem movie group rational minded thinker guide Spinozean-like morality their quest immortalize and live ethically scientific advancement and unified world government . pro-progress character ( such two cabal ) believe humanity could ' live forever ' preserve our experiment and progress future generation , always stand our humanity as shoulder giants.Arthur C. Clarke ( author 2001 : Space Odyssey ) suggest film Stanley Kubrick example excellent SF movie . Kubrick hate and say would never watch movie base Clarke 's suggestion ( source : Clarke 's special millennial introduction his 2001 novel ) . late Clarke keep suggest top his list whenever someone ask good SF movie . have beautiful Menzies art design , but mediocre special effect ( esp . toy tanks).I personally love and think excellently capture Zeitgeist modernity . be bit naive plausibility create society crime extended period time . also seem implausible inevitability progress . seem could just as easily go right back dark age or least become so stagnant science kill off overpopulation or our inability escape next major natural disaster . but nicely portray importance take risk public and nanny outrage potential threat space accident and death . challenge choose side progress petty desire safety or comfort or happiness:CABAL : " too much { rest } and too soon , and call death . but man rest and ending . must go on--conquest conquest . little planet and its wind and way , and all law mind and matt that restrain . then planet , and last out immensity star . and when have conquer all deep space and all mystery time--still will be beginning."CABAL : " be no more animals--we must snatch our little scrap happiness and live and suffer and pass , matter no more--than all other animal do--or have do . " { point out star . } " be that--or ? all universe--or nothingness ... " ( quote screenplay).If sound rationalization devote all society progress , then council member ( world government ) will seem technocrat . but actually " technocrat " allow their citizen become artisan or pursue other passion freely , and would have be suppress government ban , law science and experiment , and other mandate and restrictive use power that would turn their critic tyrants.In fact huge group rebel plot feel belittle all council 's development science and technology , so try put stop progress and end council 's freedom experiment . progress oriented council will notsuppress free speech rebel though , only prepare its ' peace gas ' time emergency and merely want freedom and space pursue its progress.So be also story freedom do science , just as much be about wonder progress . many people our society would actually agree basic premise , case social bias ( many want ban clon , example ) or naturalism ( do n't want progress freely , and would rather just become extinct due time enslave earth ) or fear/reason ( believe be n't ready advanced science/technology might destroy ) . but Cabal ( president council ) have answer problem danger : " our { scientific } revolution do notabolish death or danger . simply make death and danger worth while " ( screenplay ) .

 Delightful minor film , juggle comedy and detective , romance and drama genre as nimbly Lt Kenny Williams ( Melvyn Douglas ) balance his devotion his girl Maxine Carroll ( Joan Blondell ) and his duty force ace detective.This hodge-podge may notappeal viewer today , but its day , have something offer member movie-going family , and resolution rather tired feeling-versus-duty plot be original and refreshing , and well worth wait."The Amazing Mr. Williams " contain what must be most outrageous blind date film history , and its bright comic repartee sparkle . ludicrously frock , Melvyn Douglas deliver good line : " will walk down Main Street Turkish towel will let woman control my life ! " and effervescent Joan Blondell let her barb fly typical aplomb : " good grief ! look my Aunt Nellie ! ' crime-solving here be standard fare , fine cast character actor help bring material life.From today 's vantage point , " Amazing Mr. Williams " be perhaps most interesting its insightful commentary gender socially define construct , all more malleable its seemingly rigid boundary . much gender commentary take place superficial battle sex , time be subtle and penetrating , play out notonly fine detail film , but battle genre that reach its culmination final scene .

The Great Caruso display unique talent Mario Lanza . show great act capacity and be top form lyrical singer , pair Dorothy Kirsten , soprano Metropolitan Opera . indeed , dare say perform song well Caruso ( check A'Vuchella Tosti and La Danza Rossini ) . MGM art and music department also do good job . movie could be perfect , be notawkward presence Ann Blyth ; see be try her good , dress fifty style scene just 1920 - unforgivable . Lanza deserve good lead lady , and Blyth should stick less demanding production . also notice Ms. Kirsten sing most opera duet film Lanza , give wrong notion Caruso have kind permanent lead soprano .

there be perhaps special reason why Fox and child hit special note my heart . have just say goodbye my new fiance - oh ... one day - unknown period time , be bit overwhelm vary emotion and be suffer fallout put brave face need see.I watch few movie and TV show , but my interest dart what be leave what be out there and what have n't see . , have movie thank.Being nature lover and have hear film beforehand , be sure be go like anyway . but do n't just , love it.The technical mastery be astound . how do do ? how do capture animal way do ? ? be just wonderful.The moral tale be good one and ending be oh so French and ambiguous , be happy/sad one . again , catch bit off-guard . man who usually keep his emotion , end be tough go while plane full people would be see next 15 or so hour ! perhaps be ending make think back what left.But few hour plane , be happy see something new and original . and be life . sure , there be thing love and feel comfortable around ... but great outdoors hold many mystery . next time see something out ordinary while out open ; be go explore , observe and embrace . be precisely what happen movie and be precisely what should do darn good movie/nature doc too . positiveP.S . be two month plane journey . still do n't know when will see other again , but will .
Stories possibility post-apocalyptic future have be around age , very creation science-fiction genre per se . fact today 's society be responsible what may become future near tomorrow , and our own abuse and refusal see what be right before eye be very center story , be good or bad.Terry Gilliam course be natural kind film . give movie decadent feel , show society run rag its own excess and bring forth sense imminent tragedy have moment comedy . his world , world which Twelve MONKEYS transpire , be place where mad run wild , where city be collapse filth and neglect , where everything reek forebode luminosity opening sequence , where madness loom corner . be very dark movie , but his very good , most linear ( plot twist which hold up examination ) , and one which get well repeat viewings.A tragic event which deadly virus be unleash humanity 1996 and thus lead extermination Life planet have know lead scientist future try and make amends change humanity 's fate earth employ renegade citizen -- scum earth -- guinea pig go back time , one James Cole ( underplay great effect Bruce Willis ) .

Thats all BigV and !
give film 10 notbe superbly consistent movie , but 's pure ability evoke emotion its audience . story one-woman's-struggle-against-all-odds be old clich now , but very few film have carry off so much warmth and sincerity Color Purple.It also show different side African-American experience - show slave be grant freedom many fall way hate ' white man ' and be abusive their own people . find important point go portray-white-on-black-violence-and-win-an-Oscar trend.Also acting performance be superb - especially Oprah who now have new find respect for.Well worth watch - but keep tissue handy .
buy game impulse buy walmart . be glad do . be very entertaining listening Sean Connery and play game . think graphics be good have ever see movie/game remake . bonus level be very hard ! sniper one think be too hard , make so frustrate do n't play game week and half . there be too many people shoot nothing hide or life handle it.The only thing might change be upgrade system . do n't notice difference un-upgraded equipment upgrade , such buy armor upgrade do n't seem make armor stronger or more fill my life meter . really like Q copter . think developer do good job .
be notJohn Cleese completist ( think " Fawlty Towers be brilliant ) , but be fan , and when see sitting , neglect , shelf my local Blockbuster , decide give try . what get be wonderful surprise , and one funny 50 minute viewing experience have ever have . writing be typical English " goon show " schtick . fact , audio skit , would n't be out place " Firesign Theater " album . but execution and timing be spot and elevate " strange case " kind jaw-dropping performance that can create lifelong British comedy fanatics.The brit have gift combine broadly satirical lampoon closely observe " tic " character and timing , and creator use both good effect here . Cleese 's portrayal " Holmes " seem owe much Arkin 's and Seller 's " Inspector Clouseau " ; however Cleese have such knack physical comedy more hold his own . but unexpected treat here be Arthur Lowe , who play " Watson " genial but invincibly uncomprehending imbecile such superb timing and delivery become good aspect film . have never hear Lowe ( his background seem be vaudeville and musical theater ) , but justify his entire career performance as far be concerned.Some people might notcare " strange case ... " , especially British whimsy be n't their " cuppa tea " . but be extremely glad get see vanish sight .
This be very good , under-rated action/drama/and slightly historical movie.The basic story concern Rob Roy 's borrowing 1000 pound , its theft , and problem cause his family and indirectly his clansmen.Cunningham( Tim Roth ) be amazing villain and character story . brutally cold and watch his face seem be able turn his eye off and look completely evil.Rob Roy ( Liam Neeson ) be excellent too , but i think writer use word " honour " 1 too many times.The rest cast be strong , and whole movie be very well act and filmed.The Action be exciting and sword play very realistic , but nottoo gory . story be good and really want Rob win.All just shy classic .
plot do n't begin describe film : man be write film , or rather , *this* film . be totally self referential point think be go fold like black hole . writer write something and happen , or something happen and write it.It be very philosophical , " Waking Life " but more Zen orient and matter , much good , my opinion . point there be person-on-the-street interview and then see shot people be film , and then discover their response be script when keep flubbing her line . there be beautiful scenery and optical illusions.I hope come out DVD can watch again more carefully . see Cinequest ( San Jose , Ca film festival ) 2/25/2002 .
" Malfique " be example how horror film can be effective nothing more well-executed plot and lot heart . its cast do n't have recognize name , do n't have big budget and certainly lack visual effect aspect ; but compensate all intelligent and well-write script , effective cast and vision director focus more tell story deliver cheap thrill . Eric Valette may notbe well-know name yet , but " Malfique " , his feature length debut , prove be level contemporary Jeunet , Gans or Aja.The film be story four prisoner cell , four different man very different background but one single goal : get out . Carrre ( Grald Laroche ) get imprison be declare guilty multi-millionaire fraud ; his cell-mates , violent Marcus ( Clovis Cornillac ) , intellectual Lassalle ( Philippe Laudenbach ) and mentally challenge Pquerette ( Dimitri Rataud ) , be all convict murder and give Carrre cold welcome . their personality will clash Carrre discover ancient book detail how former prisoner escape use black magic.Written Alexandre Charlo and Franck Magnier , " Malfique " be great mix dark fantasy and horror way very reminiscent Clive Barker 's story . movie 's strong point be way build up character , be have very complex and different personality and lot tension and suspense come their constant clash personality . story 's supernatural element be very well-handle and overall give film feeling read Gothic novel . be movie four man lock room , movie never get boring or tiresome and fact , isolation group increase feeling distrust , claustrophobia , and specially , paranoia.Director Eric Valette make great use atmosphere , mood and his cast give life plot . its obvious lack budget , have craft brilliant film that feel original , fresh and very attractive . his subtle and effective camera-work help make film dynamic its single location , and slow pace film unfold be excellent create heavy atmosphere isolation and distrust movie base its plot . very few display special effect be very well-done and Valette trade quantity quality few but terrific scene gore.The character be what make film work , and cast definitely deserve credit . Grald Laroche be excellent Carrre , man first sight innocent , but who hide dark past . Philippe Laudenbach and Dimitri Rataud be very effective too , specially Rataud his very demanding role . however , be Clovis Cornillac who steal show his performance Marcus , violent and disturbed man who deep inside only want be . character be superbly develop and cast make most them.The movie be terrific , but be notits share flaw . course , most notorious one be its low-budget . CGI-effects be bit poor compare effective make-up and prosthetics use other scene , however , be never too bad . probably bad thing " Malfique " be seem lose steam end when focus supernatural black magic rather character , nottoo much bad thing but ending may seem weak point view.Anyways , " Malfique " be one great horror film come out France lately , and one that deserve have more recognition . Valette be definitely talent follow modest ( complex ) tale supernatural be prove enough his ability . personally , film be new favorite . positive
love movie . be so well do ! great acting and drama and historically accurate . love Romy Schneider movie . one rock , notas great Sissi but still rock ! and Scorpiolina,she comment and say French dubbing . well be originally German movie notFrench . so yea . second all there be plot , maybe your notfamiliar history .

compromise . be fairly charming film , like art direction ( feel far more " real " most kid movie ) , and costume be n't too cutesy . child actor be notbad watch ( adult performance trend cheesy ) . be great show how bully kid bully other as well kid stand up bullying.I do n't know how many grown up would want see , but be great film take kid . and " Barnyard " be apparently attend 100+ kid same time , be really glad pick sparsely attend show " worm " instead .
very good movie crackle tension . stake be , course , high--will police and Widmark , public health doctor , apprehend criminal who do n't know be carry plague full-scale epidemic break out ? but small plot element introduce tension scene--between Widmark and police captain , bad guy play Palance and Mostel , Palance and die plague-stricken man whom Palance mistakenly believe be subject manhunt have smuggle valuable commodity , Widmark and his wife , and underlie question public be well serve inform danger or hide situation avoid full-scale panic . movie be beautifully shoot Kazan , extraordinarily well-choreographed long take shot location New Orleans , and end stunning climax , where Palance flee rat his pursuer , dock and warehouse city . commentary be superb , probably good have hear , cover cinematography , framing and lighting shot , production design , casting non-professional actor small role , and irony and parallelism plot , insightful seminar 1950s film technique and film noir generally . watch once enjoy film its own , and , be interested film-making , second time commentary learn .

Staged most part prison cell , and four or five character , Malefique have claustrophobic air entirely suit its subject matter ( as well limited budget filmmaker ) . only start and then conclusion do get leave confine cell , necessary opening which only serve emphasise doomed , closed-in nature proceeding elsewhere . more anything , be film be trap , either victim your criminal past or occult event now unfold . " be go escape , " say Carrre start film , wish more anything be able rejoin his wife and son . or notdo will be terrible price , and great irony film be ultimate form ' escape ' may notbe one man might imagine.With all its budget limitation be greatly first-time feature director Eric Vallette 's credit his film succeed as well do . critic have notice , be film strong Freudian overtone - Lassalle 's distinctive mammaries and adult breast feeding instance ; picture vagina which come life and develop eye ; grown man who dissolve back foetus ; Danvers ' original placenta fetish ; dark cell primitive womb which ' delivery ' be await , etc. so many interesting aspect script Vallette hardly put foot wrong , and succeed create genuinely unsettling atmosphere out what , when come down , be just matter four guy , four bunk , one folding table and book . there be genuine , growing , Lovecraftian frisson man summon up unnameable darkness its page , one or two moment - aforementioned blink vagina , or what ultimately happen Pquerette - be unsettlingly memorable . pace many dark event Malefique be deliberate , reject rapid cutting many Hollywood production : video culture approach that often subvert horrify gaze favour quick-fix action and gore . perhaps be particularly European manner , recall similar , measured approach shocking hallucination take such film Verhoeven be fourth man ( 1983 ) - film incidentally also share particularly nasty image base prolapse eye.Lensed well 1.85:1 , Malefique benefit excellent performance and , viewer least , conclusion be notas explainable might have be , journey final shot be worth take . come so soon release similarly well-receive Haute Tension ( aka : switchblade Romance , 2003 ) , be reason be grateful good horror film be once again emerge French industry , time when seem only worthwhile product come Asia

wartime sitcom write Jimmy Perry and David Croft , who write TV 's good programme ever Dads Army , be notas good Dads Army , but still very , very funny.It be about concert band India . most episode be BSM Williams ( Windsor Davies ) try get concert party , who refer bunch puff , post up jungle . be always unsuccessful vague Colonel Reynolds ( Donald Hewlett ) and stupid Captain Ashwood ( Michael Knowles ) be big fan concert party . concert party consist Bombadier Solomans ( George Layton ) , Ginger Rogers impersonator Gunner " Gloria " Beaumont ( Melvyn Hayes ) , University educated piano player Gunner " La de da " Gunner Graham , a.k.a Padarouski ( John Clegg ) , singer Gunner " Lofty " Sugden , Gunner Parkins ( Christopher Mitchell ) ( Williams think Parkins be his son , be quite wrong ) , big eater Gunner " Nosher " Evans and animal impersonator 's ( Kenneth MacDonald ) , be Percy Edwards . also , heavily involve adventure be faithful Indian servant Rangi Ram ( Michael Bates ) , Char-Wallah and Punkah-Wallah ( Dino Shafeek and Babar Bhatti ) give Ram wonderful support.The show , just Dads Army leave many catchphrases .
